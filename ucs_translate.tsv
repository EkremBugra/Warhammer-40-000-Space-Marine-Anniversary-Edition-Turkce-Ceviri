117852	The Mk XI Hell's Teeth chainsword is the close-combat weapon of choice among Space Marines, combining terrifying power and great speed. Its silhouette is a symbol of the Imperium's greatest warriors.
117853	Consecrated to the dark powers of Chaos, this chainsword hums with the bloodlust of its dark masters. These dark rites have not reduced the weapon's speed or precision on the battlefield.
117854	This perfectly balanced Power Axe is sheathed in a sparking power field and delivers devastating blows able to crack open heavy armor.
117855	Favored by the dread warriors of Khorne, the hideous Chain Axe is slower to use than the chainsword, but delivers tremendous damage.
117856	The mighty Thunder Hammer is the rarest of Space Marine melee weapons. Each blow discharge a powerful blast from the hammer's dedicated power field. A powerful overhead swing creates a massive detonation, damaging all nearby enemies.
117857	A powerful daemon of hatred is bound within this huge maul, giving each blow terrible destructive power. Swinging the Daemon Maul overhead into a smash causes a detonation of foul energies that damage anyone nearby.
117858	The Astartes Mk III Bolt Pistol is a compact, slower-firing version of the Space Marine Boltgun. Designed as a backup weapon, it nonetheless provides ample stopping power.
117859	In service for millennia, this pistol pulses with the hatred of the Chaos Space Marines who have wielded it. With every bolt fired, it barks out another call for slaughter.
117860	The MK III Sunfury Plasma Pistol fires balls of super-heated plasma, making it a deadly companion to a close-combat weapon. The pistol can also fire a supercharged blast, although doing so is quick to overheat the weapon.
117861	Chaos-tainted plasma pistols fire balls of super-heated plasma, making it a deadly companion to a close-combat weapon. The pistol can also fire a supercharged blast, although doing so is quick to overheat the weapon.
117862	The standard-issue Godwyn pattern Bolter is the most characteristic weapon in the Space Marine arsenal. Firing self propelled explosive tipped rounds, each bolter is hand crafted and blessed by the chapter's Techmarines.
117863	Bearings the sigils and marks of the dread Chaos Legions, this bolter is the fearsome counterpart to the gleaming weapons of the Loyalist chapters. Each self-propelled explosive round is branded with these same dark sigils.
117864	The Storm Bolter is a double-barreled boltgun with a rate of fire just shy of that of the much bulkier Heavy Bolter. This hail of projectiles comes at the expense of stability, limiting the weapon's effectiveness at medium or long range.
117865	The product of the desecrated forges of the Iron Warriors Legion, the Twin-linked Bolter used by some Chaos Space Marines is designed to chew through any Loyalist who dares close range.
117866	Famously wielded by Ultramarines Scout Sergeant Telion, the Stalker Bolter is the hallmark of a Space Marine favoring precision over brute force. Depending on the specific modifications made by the wielder, the Stalker Bolter can serve as a precision battle rifle or a high-powered sniper weapon.
117867	The Daemon Eye Bolters used by some Chaos Space Marines have foul Warp creatures bound into them. These daemonic fiends warp space along the projectile's path, creating a weapon of deadly precision.
117868	A product of the Adeptus Mechanicus experimental weapons program, the Graia-pattern Vengeance Launcher is not authorized for use off world. Those Space Marines who have field tested the weapon, however, attest to its effectiveness against a range of targets.
117869	Stolen from Forge World Graia and desecrated in the smithies of the Iron Warriors Traitor Legion, this Tainted Vengeance Launcher honors the Dark Gods of Chaos with each victim it obliterates.
117870	The MK XII Ragefire-type Plasma Gun fires charged energy pulses able to damage heavily armored targets. This weapon is deadly, but prone to overheating. Wielders must manage heat carefully lest their weapon shutdown in the heat of battle.
117871	Adorned with the sigils of Chaos, this desecrated Plasma Gun fires charged energy pulses able to damage heavily armored targets. This rapid-fire weapon is deadly, but prone to overheating. Wielders must manage heat carefully lest their weapon shutdown in the heat of battle.
117872	The Vulkan Assault Pattern Melta Gun fires a scorching plume of molecularly agitated heat at close range. This power comes at the expense of low ammunition stores and a long recharge between shots.
117873	Sorcerous incantations have bound this Melta Gun to the forces of Chaos. It fires a scorching plume of molecularly agitated heat at close range. This power comes at the expense of low ammunition stores and a long recharge between shots.
117874	The Astartes Mk IVa Heavy Bolter replicates the staggering firepower of emplaced weapons in a form portable by a mighty Space Marine. By planting his feet, the wielder can gain increased rate of fire and accuracy at the cost of mobility.
117875	Adorned in honor of the Chaos Gods, this Tainted Heavy Bolter replicates the staggering firepower of emplaced weapons in a form portable by a mighty Chaos Space Marine. By planting his feet, the wielder can gain increased rate of fire and accuracy at the cost of mobility.
117876	The MK XIII Plasma Cannon unleashes a succession of explosive charged blasts, able to penetrate enemy armor and obstacles. The user can also unleash a devastating charged shot.
117877	Daemons of warpfire are bound in the firing chamber of the Tainted Plasma Cannon. It unleashes a succession of explosive charged blasts, able to penetrate enemy armor and obstacles. The user can also unleash a devastating charged shot.
117878	The Astartes MK VII Lascannon fires a charged energy blast along a powerful laser and can cut through almost any armor at extreme range. Features a powerful optical scope with variable magnification.
117879	Marked with dark sigils of precision and destruction, the Tainted Lascannon fires a charged energy blast along a powerful laser and can cut through almost any armor at extreme range. Features a powerful optical scope with variable magnification.

117890	The most ubiquitous Space Marine power armor, the Aquila-pattern features its titular double-headed eagle emblazoned across the chest plate. For the vast majority of humanity, the Mk7 is the only image they have of Space Marines -- epic heroes bearing gleaming armor and fearsome death's heads.
117891	An update and modification to the Mk7 'Aquila', the Errant-pattern armor features reinforced joints, covered cabling, and a new armored collar. Not yet in wide use, the small number of Errant armors released to the chapters are usually entrusted to members of the honor guard or other leaders.
117892	Most Space Marines keep their armor in gleaming condition, taking time to practice maintenance rites in the field and relying on the artificers of the chapter keeps. Some veterans, however, just as lovingly preserve some evidence of damage -- each scar acting as a memento of a past victory.
117893	Space Marine veterans collect a large number of special medals and commendations, making their armor into a record of their service. From laurels and tabards commonly awarded, to more individual awards, each veteran's deeds adorn his power armor.
117894	In the 41st Millennium, the chapter artificers spend their time rediscovering techniques lost to the past. This suit of power armor is a concrete product of such lost techniques, performing better than contemporary models in almost all ways. 
117895	Reverence of the past does not prevent the most skilled of artificers from producing true masterpieces. This lovingly customized power armor combines recovered artifacts of the past and new approaches in equal measure.
117896	Issued during the time of the Great Crusade, Maximus-pattern armor was still being deployed to Space Marines when Horus led half the legions into heresy and revolt. This fearsome armor is now a reminder of those dark days, and of the triumph of the loyalist forces.
117897	Issued in the millennia after the Horus Heresy, while work was still underway on the Mk7 Aquila pattern, the Corvus power armor was once ubiquitous among Space Marine chapters. Its most distinctive feature was a pointed helmet design, which was abandoned for the straight look of the Aquila-pattern. 
117898	There is no standard armor among the Legions of Chaos. Each Chaos Space Marine adorns himself in the best power armor he can, often pillaging new parts from any loyalist he kills.
117899	In the twisted mindset of the Chaos Space Marine, only strength and power have any real value. This foul armor is an expression of the Traitor Marine's utter disdain for anything and anyone weaker than himself.
117900	A foul expression of the hatred the Traitor Legions turn against the Emperor and Terra, this unholy armor seems to gain in power with every Loyalist its wearer kills.
117901	Chaos Space Marines who give in completely to their rage and fury gain the favor of the Blood God Khorne. They enter battle with cries of fury and descend on their foes with unparalleled savagery. Once battle has started, even their allies are fair prey for these killers.
117902	The Sorcerers of Chaos bind daemons of various types into the weapons are armors of the greatest Chaos champions. These fiendish creatures lend portions of their strength, resilience and fearsome powers in return for the souls of those slain with their aid.
117903	Nothing is quite so emblematic of Chaos Space Marines then their tendency to adorn armor and vehicles with arrays of spikes and blades. These lethal appendages are meant both to terrify the enemy and to add power to the Chaos Space Marine's close combat attacks.
117904	Abaddon the Despoiler led the Thirteenth Black Crusade out of the Eye of Terror and toward Terra. The loyalist forces tried to hold him at Cadia and suffered terrible losses. Though the crusade was ultimately repelled, many Chaos warriors still proudly wear the sigils of that great enterprise.
117905	The Blood Disciples warband includes a large number of Raptors and is feared for their aerial assaults on targets of all types. Modifications to Raptor armor made by the Blood Disciples have now found their way into many different warbands.
117906	Chaos Raptors consider themselves to be the ultimate predators of the battlefield, screeching birds of prey that rapidly turn their targets into carrion. The so-called Shock Armor is designed to enhance this impression, adding to the terror sowed through the forces of the False Emperor.
117907	Thank the Emperor.
117908	Second Lieutenant Mira, 203rd Cadian regiment.
117909	Captain Titus of the Ultramarines.
117910	You are in command?
117911	I am all that's left, my lord,
117912	unless my commanders rise from the grave.
117913	So far, they seem content to stay put.
117914	Lieutenant! The scouts have returned to forward base.
117915	How many?
117916	Two.
117917	Damn. I sent out ten.
117918	That damned gun. We don't have the numbers to make an assault.
117919	And as you might have seen, it's shooting down all our support vessels.
117920	That is why we are here. Leave the gun to us.
117921	Come with me, then.
117922	I should warn you, my lords. We've got a slight Ork problem down here.

119979	Adorned with marks of honor from the many campaigns of the Ultramarines, this Master-Crafted armor was worn by several of the Chapter's champions. Deploying with the Chapter Master or company Captains, these champions were living embodiments of the Ultramarines' honor and might.

120377	Bring the mighty Titan Invictus into the battle against Chaos.
120378	Return to Bastion Primus, facing Orks and Chaos.
120379	The Forces of Chaos have invaded the Forge World. You must stop them.

120387	With the Ork defense gun destroyed, proceed to secure the mighty Titan war machines.

120403	Press %ABILITY_CONTEXTMOTION% to Combat Roll in order to evade danger and move around the battlefield.
120404	Accurate fire is not always the best choice. Sometimes the mobility gained by firing from the hip is tactically advantageous -- and nearly as accurate at close range.
120405	Fitting a fresh magazine into a bolt weapon before it runs low on ammunition makes for a much faster reload.
120406	Use %SPRINT% to Sprint and tap %ABILITY_CONTEXTMOTION% to Combat Roll in order to avoid enemy fire.
120407	Gretchin can be dispatched quickly by pressing %ABILITY_CONTEXTINTERACT% to perform an Execution. Other foes must be stunned first.

120412	Storm Boyz relish in boarding enemy aircraft, so keep them off any way you can.
120413	Ork Boyz charge into battle in raucous groups -- perfect targets for a mighty charge attack!
120414	When forming a disciplined firing line, Imperial Guard can provide effective covering fire.
120415	A single Gretchin is no threat, but a large swarm can cut through your armor and distract you long enough for heavy units to attack.
120416	Squadmates will call out priority targets; use this to understand the changes in the battlefield.
120417	Activate Marksman Mode defensively (hold %AIM_MODE% and press %FURY_MODE%). With it, you can dodge projectiles.
120418	Ranged enemies will do their best to avoid being hit by ranged attacks. Use Marksman Mode (%AIM_MODE% + %FURY_MODE%) to dispatch them before they can evade.
120419	Regain Health by Executing enemies -- press %ABILITY_CONTEXTINTERACT% once they are stunned.
120420	Even an unarmed Space Marine is a powerful weapon. Press %SPRINT% and %ABILITY_MELEE% to charge into groups of enemies.
120421	Locate and destroy Chaos Psykers as soon as they appear -- the longer they stay active, the more Chaos troops they will usher onto the battlefield.
120422	Bloodletters phase in and out of reality, teleporting short distances and making them very hard to hit with ranged fire.
120423	Veterans of centuries of endless war, Chaos Havocs make effective use of cover and terrain.
120424	Beware! Some Renegades are so corrupt that their deaths can result in the summoning of daemons!
120425	Ard Boyz are heavily armored in looted salvage; standard Bolter fire will not penetrate their defenses.
120426	Listen for a Bomb Squig's distinctive roar and then take it  out before it can get close to you.
120427	Use explosives or heavy melee strikes to get 'Ard Boyz to lower their shields.
120428	Use a Big Nob's mob to build up Health and Fury before engaging this foe. You're going to need it!
120429	Shoota Nobz' weapons are prone to jamming. When this happens, quickly close in for the kill!
120430	Keep on the move to avoid shoota and rokkit fire and use your heaviest attacks to eliminate Big Shoota Nobz.
120431	Chaos Space Marines have a regenerating armor layer, just like Titus does. If you allow them to seek cover, they will recover and return to battle as strong as ever.
120432	Weirdboyz raise powerful psychic shields that make them highly resistant to ranged attacks.
120435	Open Conduit
120436	Close Conduit
120500	Use Combos or Grenades to stun elite opponents.

121961	LOADOUT COPIED
121962	Look for ways to flank your enemies rather than face them head-on.
121963	Use your environment to your advantage. Enemies with Jump Packs have a tough time with low ceilings or overhangs.
121964	Don't get tunnel vision, always be looking around for enemies that are above or below you.
121965	Use Braced Fire on the Heavy Bolter to hold a position, but switch up locations to avoid getting flanked.
121966	Use Frag Grenades to force enemies out of position. Follow up with another if you think you know where they will move to.
121967	Don't get discouraged. If one loadout isn't working, try something else or use a different tactic.
121968	Uncap enemy points whenever possible, even if you don't intend to capture it fully.
121969	When using the Jump Pack, time your jumps wisely or you may find yourself out of power at a crucial moment.
121970	Be unpredictable: The Jump Pack is a great tool to fake movement one way and then appear from another location.
121971	Be aggressive: Sometimes rushing an enemy who thinks you're reloading can catch them off guard.
121972	Be a master of all classes in order to handle all kinds of gameplay scenarios.
121973	If one capture point is heavily contested, try attempting to steal a less active one to move the action.
121974	Re-entering combat on captured points takes longer, but it gets you back into the fight more quickly.
121975	When waiting to re-enter combat, look for teammates who have the Teleport Homer perk equipped. You can come in on their location.
121976	The Tactical Marine's Melta Gun is the natural rival of Assault Marines/Raptors.
121977	One headshot with the Bolt Pistol will kill anyone with no Armor.
121978	The Plasma Pistol does great damage against Armor. Use it to set up your melee attacks.
121979	The Plasma Gun charged shot will completely strip anyone's Armor... Unless they are a Devastator/Havoc with an Iron Halo/Chaos Icon.
121980	With most weapons you can continue to reload even while rolling or evading.
121981	You can continue to reload while sprinting.
121982	The Storm Bolter/Twin Bolter has a great rate of fire, but its scatter makes it less effective at long ranges.
121983	The Stalker/Daemon Eye Bolter is far less accurate when fired from the hip.
121984	The experimental Graia-pattern Vengeance Launcher has charges that can be detonated in mid-air. Use it creatively.
121985	A Devastator/Havoc Marine cannot be killed by a unmodified single grenade.
121986	The Heavy Bolter is the only ballistics weapon that can overheat.
121987	The Plasma Cannon can easily kill its owner. Fire with care.
121988	One headshot with the Lascannon will kill anyone... Unless they are a Devastator/Havoc with an Iron Halo/Chaos Icon.
121989	The Serrated Combat Blade perk gives the Tactical Marines a legitimate melee kill option.
121990	Tactical Marines can use the Tactical Readout perk to prey on the weak.
121991	The Devastator/Havoc perks are primarily defensive in nature. Play accordingly.
121992	Certain perks pair together naturally, creating a specific, effective play style.
121993	The Devastator/Havoc can perform a brutal chest kick on an enemy, stopping incoming attacks and creating space.
121994	Assault Marines/Raptors can sow confusion from the air with blind grenades.
121995	If timed correctly, you can fire two Plasma Gun charged shots without overheating.
121996	The Lascannon can shoot through some objects.
121997	A Bolter with both weapon perks is one of the most effective weapons in the game.
121998	Keep an eye out for the telltale shatter of an enemy's Armor. That's the time to press the advantage.
121999	After death, you can grab your killer's loadout for one life by selecting the Copy Loadout ability before re-entering combat.
122000	If a capture point you own is blinking, that means an enemy is uncapping it.
122001	If you know an enemy Assault Marine/Raptor is targeting you from above, drop a grenade at your feet and evade away.
122002	The Devastator's stomp is an effective weapon against Assault Marines/Raptors.
122003	Grenades don't have to kill. Use them to strip armour and then close in.
122004	The Plasma Cannon's shots do much more damage with direct hits rather than splash damage at the feet.
122005	Vengeance Launcher charges do not always have be detonated. They work great as visual deterrents.
122006	Board the Ram
122007	Board the Ork ram train before it heads toward the Manufactorum.
122008	Loadout changes apply to both races.

1035915	Sidonus is badly wounded.
1035916	Sidonus is down!

1038085	Space Marines!! It’s da Space Marines!!
1038093	Waaagh!
1038100	The Orks have taken the nearby landing zone and are defending it with an autocannon.

1068161	Some Imperial Guard units made it here after all.
1068162	They cannot hold for long. 
1068163	We must hurry.
1068164	What is that servo skull doing?
1068165	Trying to deliver a message. 
1068166	Must be damaged.
1068169	What is the Inquisition doing here?
1068170	We are about to find out.
1068172	We need to find the Inquisitor before the Orks do.
1068173	Orks on the high ground!
1068174	More of them riding that platform!
1068175	Gah! Get off me!!
1068176	Use your blade!
1068177	The control room!
1068180	The Emperor Provides.
1073990	Are you wounded?
1073992	The Codex Astartes warns against using jump packs to leap blindly into enemy fire -- and for good reason.
1073993	Why do you still interpret the Codex so narrowly?
1073994	I look to its rules for guidance.
1073995	But there are also benefits to thinking for yourself, Leandros.
1073999	Sergeant, I see you found something to keep you busy.
1074006	Thank the Emperor.
1074007	Second Lieutenant Mira, 203rd Cadian regiment.
1074008	Captain Titus of the Ultramarines.
1074009	You are in command?
1074010	So far, they seem content to stay put.
1074012	How many?
1074013	Two.
1074014	Damn.
1074015	I sent out ten.
1074016	We don't have the numbers to make an assault.
1074017	Leave the gun to us.
1074018	Come with me, then.
1074027	Inquisitor Drogan?
1074031	Captain Titus of the Ultramarines.
1074046	Get the Inquisitor and the Power Source off world.
1074051	The stuff of Chaos! Heresy --
1074053	Can your blessed work help us against the Orks?
1074056	Consider that your Imperial sanction.
1074058	You didn't think to bring up this scourge weapon before?
1074060	We fire the weapon and take our chances.
1074061	Inquisitor, get back!
1074063	Drogan!
1074066	How heroic.
1074070	Traitor.
1074075	You seem surprised, Ultramarines.
1074077	But he would never have succeeded without you...
1074078	...Captain Titus.
1074079	You seem surprisingly able to resist my touch, Titus of the Ultramarines.
1074080	And that of the Warp, which impressed my servant to no end.
1074081	You have been used by my puppet of flesh and bone.
1074082	I ain't so easy to kill!
1074085	You have no idea what this is, do you, Titus of the Ultramarines?
1074086	Such a pretty bauble, hiding such immense power.
1074087	It holds the key to my evolution... to my ascension to immortal daemonhood.
1074089	My armies will spill humanity's blood across the stars.
1074090	Only a deep connection to the Warp can explain this.
1074091	Will you be joining us soon... brother?
1074093	You were right.
1074094	What do you mean?
1074095	Nemeroth plans to use the Power Source to trigger his transformation into a daemon prince.
1074096	How can we stand against such a creature?
1074097	I will kill Nemeroth when he is most vulnerable: during the transformation.
1074098	Then join the Imperial attack.
1074099	Or worse -- we know the enemy takes great interest in your connection to Chaos --
1074100	Do you fear my falling to Chaos?
1074101	But whatever lies behind your resistance, it can only be to the enemy's favor.
1074102	Why?
1074103	Perhaps this resistance can get you close enough for a killing blow.
1074104	If this 'resistance' comes into play during battle, so be it.
1074105	So be it.
1074108	If it takes a thousand years, I will rise again and take my vengeance upon your flesh --
1074110	Or will I find your arms open in welcome -- a true son of Chaos?
1074111	Never.
1074116	Captain, wake up! Get up, Titus -- now!
1074117	The damned Inquisition is here.
1074122	You understand the severity of your accusations?
1074123	Captain Titus has been corrupted by Chaos, Inquisitor Thrax.
1074124	I am no heretic.
1074126	I sent the daemon to oblivion.
1074127	You will submit to my authority, Captain.
1074129	Or the Inquisition must conclude that you have corrupted every Ultramarine under your command...
1074130	...Not to mention those who stand at your side.
1074131	Ignore his threats. Come on --
1074132	And the Ultramarines will be forever dishonored....
1074137	You cannot touch the Warp and emerge unscathed.
1074138	The Codex Astartes is a set of rules.
1074139	And you have failed.
1077183	The scouts have returned to forward base.
1083260	Your days as a novice are behind you. 
1083261	We all do. 
1083265	I am all that's left, my lord, unless my commanders rise from the grave. 
1083266	Lieutenant! 
1083267	That damned gun. 
1083268	That is why we are here. 
1083275	Very well. 
1083279	Our plan is unchanged: 
1083285	We are out of options. 
1083286	I see. 
1083287	My servant did all that I hoped, and more. 
1083288	Ah -- you think the Inquisitor a traitor. 
1083289	But Drogan has been dead since before you first met.
1083292	You continue to resist my touch.... 
1083293	Nemeroth killed Sidonus for the Power Source. 
1083294	You said the Inquisitor's work was heretical, Leandros -- 
1083295	Safeguard Sidonus until the Apothecary arrives. 
1083296	Going alone is suicide. 
1083297	Of course not. 
1083298	I will destroy Nemeroth with skill and steel, or die trying. 
1083299	You cannot kill me, Titus of the Ultramarines. 
1083300	His injuries appear Chaos-inflicted. 
1083301	You are certain of this charge? 
1083302	You lie! Only an agent of Chaos could withstand such Warp exposure --
1083303	But did you have unholy assistance? 
1083304	We must know. 
1083305	The Inquisition will destroy you, Mira. 
1083306	Leave my brothers -- and the Lieutenant -- alone. 
1083307	The Codex Astartes leaves no room for doubt:
1083308	There you are.
1083309	Sidonus. Leandros. Respond.
1083310	This is Titus. Respond.
1083311	<frustrated grunt>
1083312	If you are receiving, I am somewhere in the depths of the Manufactorum.
1083313	I have the Inquisitor’s device and am heading for the surface.
1083314	...we are going around in circles...
1083315	...do you read, Captain Titus? Respond...
1083316	...we must recover his body...
1083319	You can’t run from me, Space Marine!
1083320	Along with your head!
1083321	You're gonna die in this dark pipe, Space Marine!
1083322	Oy! Get out of there and kill this Space Marine!
1083323	Now!!
1083324	Trapped ya!
1083325	<maniacal laugh>
1083326	<scream of rage>
1083327	That does it, Space Marine!
1083328	What--
1083329	No!
1083331	I ain't finished with you yet, Space Marine!
1083332	But I am finished with you, Ork.
1083333	I HATE YOU.....
1083334	Let me in! Let me in!
1083335	....this shaft will give us a clearer signal....
1083337	This is Titus. Respond.
1083339	Captain!
1083340	Up here!
1083341	Good to see the Ork didn't get the better of you, Leandros.
1083346	The Inquisitor insisted you could not have survived.
1083347	Well, I did.
1083348	And I have his precious power source.
1083349	Is he with you?
1083351	We set a rendezvous in Hab Center Andris.
1083352	These tunnels will spit us out there eventually.
1083353	Fine. Continue heading toward the Hab Center.
1083354	I will do likewise.
1083358	Understood.
1083361	You're gonna die.
1083362	I'm gonna put your head on a spike, Space Marine.
1083363	Kill 'em all.
1083364	I wan this one's head.
1083365	My choppa's coming for ya, human!
1083366	I'll break all your bones and eat the marrow!
1083378	We are losing altitude --
1083379	We find another way down. 
1083387	Try to keep up.
1083395	Go ahead, Sergeant.
1083397	They survived this long? 
1083399	He will have updated intelligence on the Orks. 
1083401	I will meet you there.
1083409	And stay alive.
1083411	Aye, Lieutenant!
1083414	We need an update on the situation, Lieutenant.
1083415	My unit was ordered here as an advance force. 
1083416	They knew there was little chance any of us would make it out alive. 
1083417	Are you questioning the decisions of your superiors, Lieutenant?
1083418	There’s no room for niceties out here.
1083419	How did you survive this long? 
1083420	We thought you all dead.
1083421	But we’re barely holding on. 
1083422	And the gun battery?
1083424	We haven’t been able to make it inside the wall. 
1083425	There just aren't enough of us... 
1083427	You will get your reinforcements.
1083428	I’ll hold you to that, Captain. 
1083430	Those Guardsmen cannot survive that long.
1083432	We find a way to destroy the gun.
1083435	You are a man of your word, my lord.
1083437	But that was nearly two weeks ago and I've no word from the troops we sent there.
1083438	We need to reach that Titan. 
1083439	What is your situation, Lieutenant?
1083441	It leads directly to the western gates of the Manufactorum. 
1083446	We cannot allow that.
1083447	We must disable that crane.
1083451	I broke one of your Boyz, Space Marine!
1083453	<prolonged roar>
1083477	Inquisitor Drogan, we need to get you off planet before we’re overrun by Orks.
1083480	How?
1083481	Anyone not of that species remains untouched.
1083488	Come in, Lieutenant: Valkyrie Two is down.
1083489	I require immediate transport.
1083490	I will take care of the autocannon.
1083500	Initiating firing sequence.
1083501	The damned Orks have cut the main conduits to the firing tower! 
1083505	Why didn’t it work?
1083506	Never trust the Inquisition!
1083507	Stand fast, Ultramarines.
1083513	Servants of Chaos! 
1083514	Thanks to these brave Space Marines, we have broken through to this reality.
1083515	Have you looked to the skies lately, Captain Titus?
1083516	Already, our legions are pouring through. 
1083517	I must take it up the tower to the gateway itself.
1083518	Bring the Warp device. 
1083519	Clever fool.
1083547	<agonized yell>
1083548	Sidonus!
1083549	At last!
1083550	No!
1083558	I couldn't reach him in time... 
1083559	Nemeroth will pay in blood. 
1083562	All of the Chaos forces are converging at the base and preparing for...
1083563	The Sergeant!  No...
1083564	Carry on, Lieutenant. 
1083566	The liberation fleet is in orbit. Fresh troops are landing, preparing to assault the orbital spire. 
1083567	Their attack will not be enough to stop the forces of Chaos.
1083582	Titus!
1083584	Captain! Take my hand!
1083585	Pilot, proceed to the landing coordinates.
1083587	Thank the Emperor...
1083588	Look there, Ultramarine -- you have saved this world.
1083591	I see that the Ultramarines are human, after all.
1083592	More than you know, Lieutenant.
1083599	<panicked yelp>
1083600	Dis squig’s gonna blow!
1083602	Target that squig!
1083604	Look here, Captain: Melta charges.
1083606	But not the gun itself.
1083607	We could put the charge on one of the gun’s shells.
1083611	There.
1083612	I will place the charge on that shell.
1083613	It is armed.
1083614	Move the shell into place.
1083615	All loaded, Captain.
1083616	With luck, the Orks will feed it right into the gun’s chamber.
1083617	We cannot rely on luck for this, Sidonus.
1083618	We follow the shell up and make sure it reaches its destination.
1083619	<scream of rage>
1083620	We seem to have annoyed these Orks.
1083621	Shut it down!
1083622	Keep them down below!
1083623	They sabotaged the lift!
1083625	Find another way up.
1083626	There. A secondary lift.
1083627	It is deactivated.
1083633	Then we put it back.
1083634	Get the shell into that loader.
1083635	I will cover you.
1083636	In place, Captain.
1083639	Agreed.
1087060	So will I, old friend.
1087061	But we cannot just toss it down some hole.
1087062	How about putting a bolter round through it?
1087063	Too risky -- we could open another Warp Gate for all we know.
1087064	Upon our return to Macragge, I will confide it to the Chapter Master and his Librarians.
1087065	And what will you be doing while I run this little errand?
1087066	There are still thousands of traitors and heretics on this world.
1087068	Get this damned thing secured, Sergeant.
1093952	My lord, you have saved us.
1093953	You saved yourselves -- we thought you dead. 
1093955	Where will we find this Lieutenant?
1093956	Follow the trench network to the Lieutenant’s command bunker. 
1093958	Carry on, Guardsman.
1093960	Your fastest route is across the rail bridge behind the gun complex.
1093961	Understood. Titus out.
1093962	Very well.
1093973	We need to find their commander. 
1093974	Heading towards the front lines now. 
1093975	Rise, Guardsman. 
1093976	We would be, my lord, if not for the Lieutenant.
1093979	Ninth platoon can't defend the barricade without you. 
1093980	Reinforce their position -- hold the line.  
1093982	The Orks have overrun this planet, my lord.
1093983	I mean no insubordination -- I'm  simply telling you the truth of it. 
1093985	I managed to keep a few of us alive after the initial slaughter.
1093986	The Orks took it almost as soon as we got here, nearly two weeks ago. 
1093987	That’s where the Orks breached the gun battery. 
1093988	The Guardsmen will get their supplies now.
1093996	We will use this reprieve to gather our wounded and proceed with our original mission.
1093998	Our initial briefing said the Titan "Invictus" was inside Manufactorum Ajakis.
1093999	What in Guilliman’s name is that?
1094000	Nothing good.
1094001	Did the Lieutenant not say these tracks went to the complex housing the Titans?
1094002	That thing is a battering ram.
1094004	We use that personnel carrier to catch up.
1094006	Activating.
1094007	Why are we slowing?
1094008	A breach in the line ahead, Captain.
1094009	There! Another carrier.
1094010	Forward!
1094011	There it is. Make ready.
1094012	Now to stop this ram.
1094013	Time to impact?
1094015	Time enough.
1094016	Sidonus! Time to impact?
1094018	We need to deal with that dropship.
1094019	Bolter fire cannot penetrate its armor.
1094020	These trains have point defense turrets.
1094021	There will be a heavy weapon ahead.
1094022	Forward then.
1094023	Turret sighted.
1094024	Cover me while I get to that weapon!
1094025	Inside then.
1094027	I will come with you.
1094028	I do not know why I can resist the touch of Chaos, but I swear I will discover the truth. 
1094029	But how we live with those rules is the true test of a Space Marine.
1094030	Sidonus, Leandros, do you read?
1094032	What were you doing here, Midas?
1094033	You will be avenged, brother.
1094034	I swear it.
1094035	Time to die, Space Marine!
1094036	Kill ‘im, boyz!
1094037	Face me yourself, coward!
1094039	Go ahead.
1094042	Squad Solinus fought through here. 
1094043	I found Brother Midas's corpse as bait in an Ork ambush.
1094044	Should we come to you, Captain?
1094045	No, the Orks paid for their offense.
1094046	The Apothecary will need to recover Midas. 
1094047	Understood.
1094048	You ain’t leaving here alive, human!
1094049	Keep boasting, Ork.
1094050	I will finish you.
1094051	Yer shoota can’t hurt me, Space Marine!
1094052	See how you like my blade, beast.
1094053	My brain! MY BRAIN!!!!!
1094054	Captain Titus, the Orks have taken the planetary defense weapons. 
1094055	Their invasion of Forge World Graia continues unchecked.
1094058	Keeps us off their backs, while they loot the Titan war machines.
1094059	Get the ship to safety.
1094062	Or do you want to go home already, Sergeant?
1094064	The Codex Astartes does not support this action-- 
1094065	We need to get to the surface to take out the gun battery.
1094067	Farewell, Captain.
1094069	Thank you and good luck, Lieutenant.
1094079	More of them!
1094080	Dispatch them quickly!
1094081	We must hurry!
1094082	<grunt>
1094083	We can’t go that way.
1094084	We find another route then, Inquisitor.
1094085	Diggaz!
1094086	Form on the Inquisitor.
1094087	No Ork gets through!
1094088	Are we to fight through every last Ork in the sector today?
1094089	If we have to.
1094090	Inquisitor - can we get around the bulk of these Orks?
1094092	Lead the way.
1094093	There. We will proceed through that door.
1094094	I need time to override the lock, Captain.
1094095	You will have time, Inquisitor, but not an eternity.
1094096	Through here, Space Marines.
1094099	Inquisitor- find cover.
1094100	We will deal with this contraption.
1094102	These pipes lead into the facility’s sub basements.
1094104	Only krak missiles will penetrate that armor.
1094117	Get off my ship, Space Marine!
1094127	Sidonus picked up local Imperial Guard communications. 
1094131	They survived under the shadow of that gun. 
1094132	I want to know how.
1094135	At the front lines. 
1094136	We rendezvous with Sidonus, then we find this Lieutenant. 
1094137	We need updated intel on the gun battery. 
1094138	My battle brothers and I must secure any operational warlord-class Titans before the Orks can loot them.
1094139	This complex is immense. 
1094140	How will we locate the Inquisitor?
1094146	You trying to steal my Titans?
1094147	I’ll rip your guts right out your throat!
1094148	<roar>
1094149	Inquisitor, what now?
1094151	There it is...
1094156	This sparky thing what you want, Space Marine?
1094157	Never!
1094159	The whole room is coming down!
1094160	No!!
1094161	The Ork will kill us all!
1094162	Then I'll take it for myself!
1094164	No! The power source is exposed!!
1094165	Carefully now... carefully...
1094169	There he is.
1094170	Captain Titus!
1094175	Any idea of our position?
1094178	I have had enough of tunnels. 
1094179	Let’s get out of here and find the Inquisitor before the Orks do.
1094181	We are Ultramarines. Orks are not a problem.
1094182	If we had a week, perhaps.
1094183	But by then the Orks will have worked out how to dismantle the Titans.
1094184	And will have built something even worse.
1094185	We don’t have the time or numbers to deal with millions of Orks.
1094186	We need another solution.
1094187	Pilots, this is Lieutenant Mira aboard Valkyrie One. 
1094188	Look sharp. Ork flyers inbound.
1094189	Captain Titus - I need a gunner to man the heavy bolter.
1094190	Affirmative. 
1094191	Antipersonnel rounds?
1094192	Valkyrie squadron! Stormboyz incoming! 
1094193	Pilot! Match speed!
1094194	I will shoot them off!
1094195	Damned Orks.
1094196	Watch your covering fire!
1094197	That did it!
1094198	Stormboyz going for Valkyrie Three--
1094199	--and Six!
1094200	Keep us in position, pilot!
1094201	Watch for boarders!
1094202	Captain! 
1094203	Ork ship coming up! 
1094204	Starboard side!
1094205	The door gun is destroyed!
1094206	Switching to bolter!
1094208	It’s breaking into the cockpit!
1094209	I will deal with it.
1094210	Not possible, Captain.
1094211	The Orks have taken the nearby landing zone and are defending it with an autocannon.
1094212	Our Valkyries can’t get close enough to pick you up.
1094213	Tell your pilot to make his approach. 
1094214	Get fire on that Ork!
1094215	They’re flanking us!
1094217	Guardsman - Report.
1094218	My lord Space Marine...
1094219	Ork fire brought our Valkyrie down.
1094220	We survived the crash, but this place is swarming with the creatures... 
1094221	And they will return shortly.
1094222	Yes, for the time being.
1094231	Valkyrie One, come in. 
1094232	The landing pad is clear. 
1094233	The remainder of the squadron has escorted his craft to the outskirts of the Kalkys Facility.
1094234	We're on approach, Captain.
1094236	Orks from the North!
1094237	Enemies from the South!
1094238	Coming from the East!
1094239	Targets to the West!
1094240	Orks on the Left!
1094241	To the Right!
1094243	What can we expect inside, Inquisitor?
1094244	Just a few defenses.
1094245	What comprises "a few," Inquisitor?
1094246	Servo-turrets, mostly.
1094248	Set to eliminate anything with the misfortune to move within their range.
1094249	So noted.
1094250	Sentry guns ahead!
1094252	No way to move quickly with these guns everywhere.
1094254	I can do that from the central security room.
1094255	Then that is where we are headed.
1094257	These capacitors power the weapon?
1094258	No. The device your Captain carries provides the power.
1094259	These arrays channel it into the Psychic Scourge.
1094260	What is kept in these containers?
1094262	Specimens needed for my research.
1094263	There! The command room is beyond those doors.
1094264	And those sentry guns.
1094266	Ah, very good. 
1094267	All the security measures will be down shortly, Captain.
1094268	I'm afraid they were the only thing keeping the Orks outside, however.
1094269	But you will be able to fire the weapon?
1094270	Once you have the power source in place, I can trigger the firing sequence from here.
1094273	Then get to it, Inquisitor.
1094274	Of course. Security systems disabled.
1094275	Please proceed to the generator room.
1094278	You said the weapon kills only Orks. 
1094279	By targeting the enemy’s unique psychic signature. 
1094280	Tune the Scourge to the Orks. 
1094281	Or the Tyranids, or Eldar...or even human. 
1094282	But you have never fired it?
1094283	Only in an experimental setting, using a fraction of the weapon’s power. 
1094286	Our path to the Imperial Guard and their Valkyries is direct. 
1094287	Though infested with Orks.
1094293	Understood.
1094294	Inquisitor, your wound is slowing us down. 
1094296	Brothers -- take him to the Valkyries. 
1094297	I will draw the Orks off and meet you there. 
1094299	No, Drogan.
1094316	How fares the Imperial Guard, Lieutenant?
1094317	As well as can be hoped, considering we are surrounded on all sides by the enemy horde. 
1094318	He said you require air transport to the Kalkys facility.
1094324	Captain - Assault support pods were dropped in this area.
1094325	That might aid you in drawing some attention.
1094326	That it will.
1094327	Now to knock over some Ork nests.
1094328	Kill. Them. ALLLL!!!
1094329	Left flank!
1094330	Keep firing!
1094331	We need support!
1094332	Our position is under heavy assault!
1094333	My lord. . . We owe you our lives.
1094334	I am an instrument of the Emperor’s will, trooper.
1094335	Now indicate to me the nearest concentration of Orks.
1094336	Of- of course, my lord.
1094337	It is swarming with the beasts.
1094338	Marsis Plaza is just past this hab complex.
1094339	Not for long.
1094341	Oy!
1094342	That Space Marine’s got the shiny bit Boss Grimskull’s after!
1094343	That’s it.
1094344	Kill ‘im!
1094345	Get me that bit!!
1094346	This is Primus Command! 
1094347	Orks inside the perimeter!
1094348	Move to secondary defense positions and hold the line!
1094349	Now, Captain, you must connect the weapon’s primary capacitor arrays.
1094350	Can you open a route there?
1094351	Ah- Yes, yes.
1094352	I will unseal the blast doors from here.
1094353	Here come the Orks.
1094354	We are at the first chamber, Inquisitor.
1094355	Excellent.
1094356	Carefully reconnect the capacitor arrays.
1094357	That was the last one.
1094358	Inquisitor - all these capacitors are in place.
1094359	Very good. 
1094360	Proceed across to the second chamber.
1094361	I’m afraid you are doing the work of a hundred servitors.
1094362	Here they come!
1094363	Keep moving.
1094364	Inquisitor! Orks are in the main hall.
1094365	Keep the command room sealed.
1094367	We are at the second chamber.
1094368	Disconnect them and the firing can begin.
1094369	Get the capacitors into place.
1094370	Sidonus, Leandros.
1094371	Guard the approaches while I get these capacitors into place.
1094372	Understood.
1094373	Orks coming in!
1094374	Get these Orks off me!
1094375	Keep at it. 
1094376	I will deal with the Orks.
1094377	Doors opening now.
1094378	There. The doors are opening now.
1094379	Opening.
1094381	Inquisitor! Close that door!
1102122	Keep moving.
1102123	We need to get clear of this place.
1102124	Not this way.
1102125	Back down here.
1102126	I feel the power of the Warp!
1102127	By the Emperor...
1102128	Kill the psykers.
1102129	Captain Titus, are you there?
1102130	This is Lieutenant Mira.
1102131	Go ahead, Lieutenant.
1102132	Thank Terra-- 
1102134	What is your status?
1102135	My status? This whole planet has gone mad! The skies are on--
1102136	Lieutenant!
1102137	The forces of Chaos are invading this world.
1102138	Do not give in to fear now.
1102139	I won't, Captain. 
1102140	I am aboard Valkyrie One and headed toward the Kalkys facility.
1102142	The facility is under Chaos control.
1102143	Divert to the canyons immediately south.
1102144	Understood. 
1102145	Mira out.
1102146	Lieutenant - get your men to hold the right flank.
1102147	We will break the main assault.
1102148	On it.
1102149	Third and Fourth Platoons! Form a field of fire between Bastion Primus and the boulevard!
1102150	We are too few to cover every approach.
1102151	At least the sentry guns are holding.
1102152	The guns have shut down!
1102153	There’s no power!
1102155	Servitors must have kept it going despite everything.
1102157	Eyes front. Enemy targets.
1102170	Where is it?
1102171	The device is secure, Drogan.
1102172	What are you waiting for, then?
1102173	Further delay is intolerable. 
1102175	Yes.
1102176	Come -- we’ve no time to waste.
1102178	Perhaps. 
1102179	Keep an eye on him.
1102182	Captain, my servitors were destroyed in the initial attack.
1102183	I may need your help to activate the Psychic Scourge.
1102184	How large is the weapon?
1102185	The firing mechanism is at my research lab.
1102186	But the energy pulse itself travels along conduits from the lab to the orbital spire.
1102187	I thought the spire to be a ground-to-space transporter.
1102188	It is.
1102189	With a few modifications, it also makes an ideal firing tower.  
1102190	The energy pulse shouldn’t damage the spire...
1102193	Improvisation and experimentation go hand in hand.
1102231	Ah, very good, Captain.
1102232	Your time carrying my power source is finally at an end.
1102233	Stand by for weapon firing.
1102234	How long will it take?
1102235	No more than a few moments. 
1102236	Or a few minutes. 
1102238	Where?
1102239	In the firing chamber.
1102240	You must reconnect the conduits, Captain, or we're facing an overload that will rip this planet apart. 
1102241	Understood.
1102246	We can handle a few Orks. 
1102247	Space Marine!
1102248	Was that supposed to hurt?
1102251	You got new friends now, Space Marine?
1102252	Chaos daemons? 
1102253	How is this possible...
1102254	Get the Inquisitor out of here.
1102255	I will get the power source.
1102256	Titus!
1102258	This is Thunderhawk Lance of Jove.
1102262	I will need all your skill, pilot.
1102263	I will take you into the Eye of Terror if you ask it, Captain.
1102264	The Orbital Spire will do for today, brother.
1102267	Understood.
1102271	Targeting now.
1102278	Keep on them!
1102281	One less traitor to plague us.
1102282	Hell Talon destroyed.
1102288	Obstacle ahead!
1102295	It may be severed, but it is still the enemy’s strong point.
1102296	And the fiend leading this invasion is still atop it.
1102297	What in the Emperor’s name are they doing atop that thing?
1102298	The Emperor has nothing to do with the horrors occurring there.
1102302	The slave of the false Emperor was trying to save this planet from one invasion.
1102303	Instead, he ushered in another.
1102304	You opened a gateway to the Chaos realm, Captain. 
1102305	Your pathetic Imperial forces will be scoured clean from this world.
1102306	The blessed gateway is not yet large enough to fulfill my plans.
1102307	I will use the Warp device to speed its expansion.
1102308	Soon, my entire invasion fleet will cross into this reality!
1102309	<pained roar>
1102312	You survived...again.
1102314	Move out. 
1102315	Now!
1102317	Get the Warp device!
1102320	Did that fiend speak truth? 
1102321	Did we cause a Chaos invasion?
1102322	Of course we did. 
1102323	His Inquisitor puppet manipulated us from the moment we met. 
1102324	And before! 
1102325	The false Inquisitor sent the distress call --
1102326	I don’t think so, Leandros.
1102327	The man’s urgency, his fear...I believe that was the real Drogan, facing certain death.
1102328	And it found him.
1102329	But not at the Orks’ hands. 
1102330	Somehow, the agents of Chaos were already here. 
1102332	But why?
1102333	Most likely to travel the Forge World unquestioned. 
1102334	The daemon needed the power source to fire the Psychic Scourge and open a Warp portal for its master to cross over.
1102335	Why did it wait, then? 
1102336	It never bargained on an Ork invasion. 
1102337	Alone, there was no way the daemon could get the power source past a million Orks.
1102338	It needed help.
1102339	And we obliged.
1102340	I was deceived. 
1102341	I am responsible for Chaos breaking through to this world. 
1102344	Captain Titus, duty requires me to speak to you about a certain matter. 
1102345	Speak, then.
1102346	You held the unshielded power source again, Captain.
1102347	And again, you emerged from the exposure unscathed.
1102349	The Codex Astartes concurs with what the false Inquisitor said about Warp exposure -- it is deadly.
1102350	And you are wondering how I survived a second encounter.
1102351	Yes, Captain.
1102352	I have no answers for you, Leandros.
1102353	But I want to hear what you are leaving unsaid.
1102354	The Codex Astartes warns that those in league with Chaos can withstand the Warp’s touch.
1102355	You forget yourself, Ultramarine --
1102356	Leandros, I do not take this Warp resistance lightly.
1102357	But the search for answers must wait until after we deal with this Chaos invasion.
1102358	What if that is too late? 
1102360	Leandros, enough. 
1102374	Captain Titus, respond!
1102375	Lieutenant, watch your back!
1102376	We’ve lost control --
1102377	Lieutenant!
1102378	Ultramarines, move!
1114760	There: hold this crossing and we can stem the tide.
1114763	And that means delaying the Orks, Inquisitor.
1114764	Captain - We can deny them access with this machinery.
1114765	Do it.
1114768	This way.
1114770	Under here.
1114771	Up the stairs.
1114772	Kill the weak!
1114773	Holy Emperor...
1114775	Brothers- Attack!
1114776	How... How can we face them...
1114777	The Legions of Chaos...
1114778	Trooper! Get yourself together right now!
1114779	Look! The Emperor's own Ultramarines stand with us.
1114780	That is how we will face these traitors and cowards!
1114781	That is how we will triumph!
1114782	Yes, ma'am.
1114783	What was that, trooper?
1114784	YES MA'AM!
1114787	Hold on, brother.
1114788	You are still living.
1114793	Another life you owe me, Nemeroth.
1131442	What could make trained soldiers forsake the Emperor?
1131444	We have no way of knowing.
1131445	But we can show these heretics the error of their ways.
1131446	Lieutenant Mira?
1131447	<cough>
1131448	Here, my lord.
1131450	I’ll survive.
1131451	But my pilot -- he’s gone.
1131452	And we have lost our air transport.
1131453	I lost a good man, my lord.
1131454	His name was Valerian.
1131455	He gave his life to come to your aid --
1131456	Lieutenant, we appreciate his sacrifice.
1131457	But we cannot linger -- the enemy is tracking us.
1131458	Captain, before my ship crashed, I had a clear view of the orbital spire.
1131459	The entire tower is enveloped in energy, shooting up the spire and into the vortex.
1131460	The energies must be feeding the Warp Gate.
1131461	Even as I watched, the gate grew wider. 
1131463	Then we must cut the link between Warp gate and tower. 
1131465	We use Invictus to sever the orbital spire. 
1131472	Then we need to get back to my command post at Bastion Primus. 
1131473	I know what route to take.
1131474	Lead on, Lieutenant.
1131475	This way, my lords.
1131476	You know this route well, Lieutenant Mira.
1131477	Yes, Sergeant.
1131478	I deployed troops to man outposts between the Kalkys facility and Bastion Primus. 
1131483	Thank you, my lord. 
1131486	Well met, Mira! 
1131487	Jonah! 
1131488	I half expected to find a daemon chewing on your bones.
1131489	They’d spit me right out...
1131495	Make your report, Jonah. 
1131496	We’ve seen minimal enemy activity.
1131497	But I don't know the status of the other platoons. 
1131504	Tariq was a loyal soldier. 
1131505	And a good friend.
1131506	There will be time for grief --
1131507	Later.  
1131508	I know.
1131509	How do you bear it?
1131510	How do you live with knowing that your orders caused the deaths of your men?
1131511	I find solace in ritual and duty, Lieutenant. 
1131513	And once again, we find the Orks in our path.
1131514	Not for long.
1131516	Guard the perimeter.
1131517	I will restore power to the sentry guns.
1131519	Your Chaos friends were no match for Grimskull!
1131520	You have been at my heels for long enough, Ork.
1131521	This ends, now.
1131522	That’s right.
1131523	Because I’m gonna kill you, Space Marine!
1131524	<howl>
1131525	[CRIES OF TERROR]
1131526	Sidonus, come in.
1131527	The damned Ork is dead.
1131529	Lieutenant, what is your situation?
1131530	The Orks are running scared, my lord.
1131531	Bolster your defenses. 
1131532	The daemon host will not be so easy to frighten off.
1131535	Good luck, Titus.
1131537	Mira, out.
1131549	That's done it, Titus.
1131550	The gate is closed!
1131553	But Nemeroth and his daemon host still roam free.
1131554	And he will be desperate to get the power source now that he's stranded on this world.
1131555	You think the device is still of use to Nemeroth, without the Warp gate?
1131557	Who knows what evil he could do with it?
1131558	We must get the device to safety -- to Macragge and the protection of our Chapter Master.
1131559	Sidonus, contact our allies and find a way off this planet.
1131560	Yes, Captain.
1131561	Now to get out of here.
1131563	Captain, good news. 
1131566	I’ve got the rendezvous coordinates.
1131567	Excellent. 
1131568	Contact the Thunderhawk pilots -- we need immediate lift-off.
1131569	Yes, sir.
1131570	And inform command that we’re bringing aboard a device with possible Chaos connections.
1131571	Understood.
1131572	If the liberation fleet is here, Captain, they will have ships from the Inquisition.
1131573	Most likely.
1131574	Then, should not the Warp device be turned over to them?
1131575	The true Inquisitor must have developed it under their orders.
1131579	But is it not the Inquisition's purpose to safeguard such a device? 
1131582	No one must use the device, Leandros, ever again.
1131583	I see you, Ultramarines!
1131584	The traitor lord -- Go! 
1131585	Nemeroth must not get the power source!
1131586	Go to glory, my friend.
1131587	Do not give in to grief, Leandros.
1131588	Turn your thoughts to vengeance.
1131589	Captain Titus, my scouts report that Nemeroth is ascending what’s left of the orbital spire.
1131591	Blood Ravens Squad Corvus reporting in, Captain Titus. 
1131593	Then join the forces driving into the daemon host.
1131594	And stop any enemies trying to follow me up the orbital spire.
1131595	None shall find us wanting, Ultramarine.
1131596	Honor and glory, Blood Raven.
1131601	You challenged me to recover this fragment of your power, and I have done so!
1131602	I am Nemeroth, your herald and champion!
1131603	I return your dark relic to you...
1131604	You want to talk to your gods?
1131605	I will send you to them!
1131606	The Loyalist is here!
1131607	He thinks to face me in battle!
1131608	Grant me your favor!
1131609	Corrupt my flesh, make me daemonkind!
1131610	Show this fool the true nature of power!
1131612	<laughter>
1131616	Nothing can stop my ascension!
1131617	I will stop it.
1131621	Find that rocket launcher and eliminate the Ork using it.
1131622	There is likely a supply drop pod nearby.
1131623	Supply drop pod ahead, Captain.
1131624	Resupply point.
1131625	One of our supply drop pods.
1131626	The Emperor’s Angels of Death fight with us!
1131627	The Adeptus Astartes are here!
1131628	Space Marines! Thank the Emperor!
1131629	Understood.
1131630	Affirmative.
1131631	Yes.
1131632	Attack!
1131633	Forward!
1131634	Ultramarines attack!
1131635	Into them!
1131636	Destroy the enemy!
1131637	Continue ahead.
1131638	We need to get through, brothers.
1131639	Keep moving. Remain alert.
1131640	Forward.
1140372	I have burned a thousand worlds in your dark names!
1140374	You are no threat to me now, Ultramarine. 
1140375	Your task is hopeless, Titus.
1140376	I have the will of the Dark Gods behind me.
1140377	But you? 
1140378	You have no one. 
1140379	And you will die here, alone.
1140380	Killing my servants matters little.
1140381	I am unassailable. 
1140382	The gods of Chaos protect me with the very energies of creation.
1140383	You forget, Nemeroth. 
1140384	I am no stranger to the touch of the Warp!
1140385	<pained roar>
1140387	<roar>
1140388	Got you.
1149158	This place is a killing field.
1149159	Cross quickly and use what cover we have.
1149160	Incoming enemy fire!
1149162	Move to cover!
1149163	More Greenskins!
1149164	Keep firing! Keep firing!
1149165	Why won’t it die?!
1149166	For the Regiment!
1149167	Die you bloody heretic!
1149168	Daemons! Daemons!
1149169	The Emperor Protects!
1149170	Where are they all coming from?!
1149171	Kill every last one of ‘em!
1149172	I’m here for your heads, humans!
1149173	You're all gonna die!
1149174	I’ll snap their bones!
1149175	Give me more humans to kill!
1149176	I’ll grind you into paste!
1149177	No humans can stop me!
1149178	Time for you to die!
1157994	What is the Inquisitor’s status?
1157996	Hah! This place is gonna be your grave, human!
1157998	Explosives will clear the way.
1157999	More of them!
1158000	Get a grenade into that damn machine!
1158002	Cleaner than most underhives I’ve seen.
1158003	At least until the Orks got here.
1158004	At last - a way to the surface.
1158006	Not much tidier than below, but at least we have the sky over our heads again.
1158007	What could the Orks hope to gain by slaughtering so many?
1158010	Cruel, but effective.
1158011	This was no strategy of war.
1158012	For Orks, this was sport.
1158014	Report to your designated shelters for the duration of the emergency...
1158015	Work quotas have been reduced by 1% to account for emergency disruption of production...
1158016	All workers of class nine and above must report for their shifts despite the emergency...
1158017	Remember that we honor the Machine God by exceeding quotas...
1158019	More roks!
1158020	Beware those roks!
1158024	There must be a way out of here.
1158026	The chamber is infested!
1158027	Clear it out! No mercy!
1158028	Captain! You must hurry!
1158029	The weapon is reaching critical!
1158030	What am I looking for, Inquisitor?
1158031	The conduits that lead into the firing mechanism! 
1158032	They must be in place!
1158033	Look at the chamber’s periphery!
1158034	I’ve been looking for you, Space Marine.
1158035	You got something of mine!
1158037	Get the conduits in place!
1158038	Nothing else matters!
1158039	It is done!
1158040	Inquisitor! Fire the weapon!
1158044	To the lift!
1158045	Captain--
1158046	Keep moving!
1158047	Foul daemons!
1158048	Fight through them! No stopping!
1158050	To the exit!
1158051	Keep moving!
1158052	I only hope the Invictus itself has not fallen.
1158055	We will not allow that. 
1158056	No matter the cost.
1158057	We need to get this open.
1158058	Clear this obstacle and we can keep going.
1158059	We make an opening.
1158060	We must break through.
1158061	The way is clear.
1158062	Open.
1158063	This way.
1158065	And not fully dormant.
1158101	Turn, blast you!
1158103	There is much blood on your hands, Nemeroth.
1158104	For all those you have killed... for Sidonus... and for the Emperor, I will finish this.
1158106	This madness will not stop me!
1158107	And neither will you!
1158108	I will feed you to the Dark Gods myself, Ultramarine.
1158109	Your brothers thought the same, Traitor.
1158110	Their corpses lie behind me.
1158111	The Dark Gods have forsaken us!
1158112	The world grows dark!
1158113	For the final glory of Chaos!
1158114	Hold the door! 
1158115	Kill the Loyalist!
1158118	No. The structure is too robust.
1158119	Now to move the shell into place.
1158120	There must a control panel nearby.
1158121	There's our shell.
1158122	We need to get the shell into that loader.
1158123	Find an exit.
1162661	Captain Titus... are you there?
1162663	Go ahead, Lieutenant.
1162664	Thank you.
1162665	Markedly improved.
1162666	Which was?
1162668	To establish a field depot at the main plaza in the Andris Habitation Center.
1162669	With the cannon down, our support craft will land there.
1167223	Our unit was the only one to make landfall before they gained control -- now none of our ships can get past the gun.
1167224	You have survived this long on your own, Lieutenant -- you have done well.
1167225	But you are no longer alone.
1167226	We will retake the gun. 
1167227	The Ork chieftain wanted the Power Source. 
1167241	<roar>
1244984	The Psychic Scourge is at the Kalkys facility -- my research laboratories.
1244985	We will need transportation.
1244988	We can fly to the research facility.
1244989	Let’s find this Imperial Guard outpost.
1244991	You think you can walk out of here with that sparky thing?
1244992	I’m Boss Grimskull!
1244993	This whole planet is mine!
1244994	I’m gonna take apart yer weak little war titans, Space Marine!
1244995	And then I'm gonna build the biggest Kannon you’ve ever seen!
1244996	Fifth platoon to Primus Command! 
1244997	Your debt is to Him; repay it in service.
1244998	The Emperor Protects.
1244999	Aye, my lord.
1245000	Your shots won’t penetrate Valkyrie armor, but they’ll cut right through soft targets.
1245002	They were on us almost immediately.
1245003	Prepare your men - we shall repel their attack.
1245004	That seems the last of them, my lord.
1245005	Remain here with your wounded
1245006	I will clear the nearby landing zone.
1245007	You may then call for extraction.
1245008	Yes, my lord.
1245011	Very good. 
1249630	Yes, perhaps.
1249631	My research produces minimal waste, so the facility's sluiceways should be accessible.
1249632	The energy involved is tremendous.
1249633	Indeed. 
1249634	Once the process begins, nothing can stop those capacitors from discharging.
1249635	Place the canister into its cradle inside the power core, Captain.
1249636	Do we risk exposure again?
1249637	Only if you drop the canister.
1249639	What remains to be done,  Inquisitor?
1249643	Steal my loot?
1263549	It is a fair distance.
1263550	They will have Valkyries.
1263551	Please follow me.
1263552	Sergeant Sidonus briefed me about the Inquisitor and his doomsday weapon.
1263553	Your Valkyries are the fastest way to reach it. 
1263554	And we have no time to spare. 
1263555	The honored Inquisitor implied as much when he commandeered the fleet.
1263556	Apologies, Captain.
1263557	I would have sent the squadron, regardless of the Inquisitor’s orders.
1263558	It’s time the Imperial Guard brought the fight to the Orks.
1263560	Your men are already on board their Valkyrie, and the squadron’s ready for lift off.
1263562	They’re just waiting for your word.
1263563	Who is commanding this flight?
1263564	I am, Captain.
1263566	We’ll get you to Kalkys with all speed.
1263567	I must return to base -- those damned Ork fliers cost me too many good men, and too many gunships--
1263568	We'll be hard-pressed to defend the outpost.
1263571	There.
1263574	Inquisitor Drogan, may I enquire as to the workings of this facility?
1263578	That is the business of the Inquisition, Ultramarines.
1263579	The firing core is still active.
1263580	Excellent.
1263585	You think you’re big enough to hurt me?
1263586	You’ve got some guts to take me on!
1263587	You still have the power box!
1263588	I want it!
1263589	Damn humie!
1263590	Stand still so I can kill you!
1263591	Why do you give me so much trouble, Space Marine? 
1263594	<roar>
1263596	I hate you...
1263598	Understood.
1263599	All our hopes are with you.
1263601	Thank the Emperor...
1263602	No.
1263603	Such terrible power should be kept out of the Inquisition’s reach.
1263604	I don’t understand.
1263607	Abomination...
1263608	Dread Gods of Chaos...
1263609	The slaves of the False Emperor who dared claim it as their own lie dead at my hand!
1263610	I ask for the reward that was promised!
1263611	<laughter>
1263617	Brace for evasive maneuvers.
1263618	Pilot: Report.
1263619	Starboard engine is dead, Sergeant.
1263621	Aye, Captain.
1263622	Thunderhawk Lance of Jove returning to launch bay....
1263624	I’m gonna twist off your head and paint these walls with your blood!
1263626	Admirable, but we still have to stop this ram.
1263627	There will be a command console in the engine room.
1263628	The Orks have destroyed the consoles.
1263629	Do the same to the engines, then.
1263630	Open fire!
1263631	This machine is too resilient.
1263632	We need another tactic.
1263633	The Orks have the front of this engine loaded with explosives.
1263635	Get me a line of sight to those charges.
1263640	The Manufactorum still holds!
1263641	What is that crane doing?
1263643	No... The Orks are operating it...
1263644	They are making a bridge!
1263645	Forward! Clear out the Orks.
1263646	Xenos purged.
1263647	Captain-
1263648	I believe this is the release mechanism.
1263651	Agreed.
1263652	Imperial Guard units defending the Manufactorum gates -
1263653	This is Captain Titus of the  Ultramarines.
1263654	This is Corporal Antioch, sir ... That is, my lord... 
1263655	Did you drop that cargo on the Orks? 
1263657	We did.
1263658	I need access to the Manufactorum, Corporal.
1263660	There is a service lift in the hangar directly below where you dropped the cargo, my lord.
1263661	Stand ready; we will be there shortly.
1263662	Titus out.
1263663	We can meet you there.
1263665	Corporal Antioch?
1263666	Yes, my lord.
1263667	I will show you the way inside.
1263669	Has the Liberation Fleet arrived, my lord?
1263671	The Fleet is still en route, Corporal.
1263672	The Ultramarines are here as a vanguard, to cripple the enemy and secure the most valuable assets.
1263673	I see.
1263674	We have word that an Inquisitor is in the Manufactorum.
1263675	Yes - Lord Drogan.
1263676	He was of great aid when we cut the main rail bridge.
1263677	Where is he now?
1263678	I- I do not know, my lord.
1263679	We have not seen him in several days.
1263680	Fine. 
1263681	But the facility - and its Titans - remain secure?
1263682	All I can say for certain is that no Ork has breached this gate, my lord.
1263685	You will not hold the gate much longer without resupply and reinforcement, Corporal.
1263686	Contact Lieutenant Mira.
1263687	Her unit is establishing a bastion in Hab Center Andris, and your support craft now have a viable approach from orbit.
1263688	I know, my lord.
1263689	What of the Colonel and his staff?
1263690	Here we are, my lord.
1263691	My thanks, Corporal.
1263692	From there, you can access the rail network and cross to Manufactorum Ajakis.
1263715	Quickly!
1263717	Captain - Get to the maintenance apse!
1263750	Admit it, Titus.
1263751	The power of Chaos is within you, calling to this relic.
1263753	Imagine the Ultramarines dominating this galaxy in glorious conquest, with you at their head.
1263754	Imagine the power you could wield--
1263755	-- as a slave to Chaos?
1263756	Nothing you say can tempt me from the path of honor -- or from avenging the deaths of my battle brothers.
1263759	No.
1263760	And until then?
1263761	My most trusted brother will bring it to our battle barge and seal it in the armory.
1263762	I intend to drastically thin their ranks.
1278308	Aye, Captain.
1278312	Understood.
1292880	We joined the Liberation Fleet at Bakka, along with a squad of Black Templars.
1292882	Unleash the fury you showed in the Aurelian Crusade, and we will be glad to have even a few Blood Ravens with us.
1292883	You may rely on that, Captain.
1292911	We will have this open momentarily, Inquisitor.
1302690	No... this is some form of diagnostic system...
1302700	Captain - you must get to that maintenance station on the right shoulder.
1302704	Target the Orbital Spire.
1302705	Elevation: two thousand meters.
1302706	Target acquired.
1302708	Alarm!
1302709	Litanies of Safety failing...
1302711	Ejecting power core...
1302712	Shutting down all systems...
1302718	Inquisitor. We will need heavy vehicles to move so huge a device.
1302721	Brothers - guard the access points.
1302722	Aye.
1302723	Captain Titus, go to the main console and I will guide you through the process.
1302724	What do you need me to do, Inquisitor?
1302725	The device must be handled with care.
1302726	We will remove it from the generator and transfer it to a protective canister.
1302727	Now, set the master control in front of you to Position Seven.
1302728	Now, set the large dial on the left to "Open".
1302729	Depress the following switches: One, Three, Six, Ten.
1302730	Move the master control to Position Eight.
1302731	Captain! Orks in the generator room!
1302732	Xenos breaking through!
1302733	Orks in the chamber!
1302734	Greenskins breaking in!
1302735	Back to the command console, Captain Titus.
1302736	I still need you at that console, Captain.
1302740	There's a strategy behind it. 
1302741	Their leader is no fool. 
1302751	Space Marine!
1302752	You are wounded, Inquisitor Drogan.
1302754	This device is a gift from the Chaos gods.
1302757	Well done, Captain.
1302758	Stop the Space Marines!
1302759	Kill 'em!
1302760	Throw them ‘umans off our train!
1302761	Lieutenant Mira? 
1302762	They did not survive.
1302767	If the Orks are executing their Warlord's strategy, then they will lose their direction if we kill him, correct?
1302769	I may have encountered the Ork during our jump to the surface.
1302770	Where?
1302771	On the hull of his ship.
1302772	Before I sent it crashing to the ground.
1302773	And you think he survived? 
1302774	If the horde hasn't turned on itself, it's still under his control. 
1302775	The Ork is alive, without doubt.
1302776	But typical Ork behavior would be to dismantle or destroy the gun...
1302777	And certainly not use it to keep our forces at bay.
1302778	...you saw the damned gun blast our ships out of the sky. 
1302779	Our reinforcements -- our comrades -- are dead. 
1302780	And we're still on our own.
1302781	But our duty remains unchanged.  
1302782	Forgive my tone, my lords. 
1302783	And as you might have seen, it's shooting down all our support vessels. 
1302785	I should warn you, my lords.
1302786	We've got a slight Ork problem down here.
1332716	The power source is returning to the generator!
1332717	Captain! Grab it!
1332719	Death can wait; your duty is to fight on.
1332720	On your feet, Brother!
1332721	The fight is not over, brother.
1332722	Rise!
1332723	There is still work to be done, brother.
1332724	Return to battle, brother.
1332725	We still have need of your bolter, brother.
1332726	So small a wound will not be the end of you, surely.
1332727	Back to the battle, sergeant.
1332728	Up. Make the enemy pay.
1332729	Get up.
1332730	Fight on, Sidonus!
1332731	Up, old friend.
1332732	No time for rest, sergeant.
1332733	Back to your feet.
1332734	Another scar for your collection?
1332735	On your feet, Ultramarine!
1332736	Leandros! Rise!
1332737	Time enough to die later.
1332738	Up!
1332739	Redeem yourself in battle, Leandros.
1332740	Rise and avenge yourself.
1332741	Get up. The enemy has need of a lesson from you.
1332742	This is no time for rest, Ultramarine.
1332743	Damned beast!
1332744	Disgusting thing!
1332745	Hah!
1332746	Die!
1332747	No running for you.
1332748	Begone, beast.
1332749	Foul thing.
1332750	Farewell, Xenos.
1332758	A worthy strike.
1332768	Good kill.
1332791	Once we reach the generator room, how difficult will the power source be to remove?
1332795	We received your distress call, but you seem to have weathered the enemy's attack.
1332796	What is the status of the experimental device?
1332799	This device is a fuel source, not a weapon?
1332801	Then we must move it to safety.
1332819	If you cannot reach the power source, then neither can the Orks.
1337914	I’ll take that -- 
1337915	Likewise, Captain.
1337916	Our rendezvous point is this way.
1353206	No running away, Space Marine!
1353207	Thanks, Valkyrie Two!
1353208	I offer up this world and all those upon it...
1353211	Welcome to Bastion Primus, Captain.
1363419	When his Orks see I possess it, not you, they will follow me.
1363420	Move out.
1368529	We will discover many truths, Space Marine...
1368530	They guide us... shape us as Ultramarines... teach us to hold duty and honor sacred above all.
1368531	Oh, yes.
1368533	We will provide cover from here!
1368537	At that range, will the Titan's cannon be effective?
1368541	I mean -- Lieutenant Mira.
1368542	Very well.
1368543	Don't let your guard down.
1368544	We won't, Lieutenant.
1368547	Sidonus died as we all should -- in righteous battle.
1368548	Is that wise, Captain? 
1368549	The Inquisition has already failed to stop its exploitation by Chaos.
1373679	Good. 
1373680	The. . . improper capacitors are in place there. 
1373681	With it, you shattered this mighty spire -- but so much more awaits.
1373682	Affirmative.
1373683	Already loaded, sir.
1373684	Here they come! Starboard side!
1373685	More Stormboyz!
1373686	That was close!
1373687	Valkyrie Seven here! I’ve got boarders!
1373688	Affirmative.
1373689	<scream>
1373690	Trying, sir.
1373691	Valkyrie Three clear!
1373692	Losing control!
1373693	<scream>
1373694	Valkyrie Six free and clear!
1373695	Thanks!
1373696	<scream>
1373697	They’re right behind us!
1373698	Port side!
1373699	<laughter>
1373700	This place reeks of Xenos filth.
1373701	Get up!
1373702	Rise!
1373721	Warp daemons ahead.
1373722	Heretics and renegades.
1373723	The Traitor Legions!
1373724	The forces of Chaos.
1373725	The Enemies of Man are here!
1373726	The minions of Chaos are here!
1373727	The time for battle is now!
1373728	Our foes grow in strength.
1373729	Behold -- traitors in the flesh.
1373730	The Ork horde is upon us!
1373731	More of the beasts.
1373732	Greenskins.
1373733	Xenos.
1373734	Orks. Always more Orks.
1373735	Greenskins. Make ready!
1373736	The enemy wishes us to fight, brothers! Let us indulge them!
1373737	The green tide rises.
1373739	Xenos spotted.
1373740	Aye.
1373741	Let us proceed, then.
1373742	Very good.
1373743	As you say.
1373744	Onward, then.
1373745	Yes, brother.
1373746	Bodies break but our wills endure!
1373747	Duty is its own reward.
1373748	Fear has no place in my mind.
1373749	A battle won is not worth a war lost.
1373750	My faith is my shield. My fury is my sword.
1373751	Never forget. Never forgive.
1373752	Attack!
1373753	Brothers, fire!
1373754	Cleanse and purge.
1373755	Crack that daemon armor!
1373756	Deploy charges.
1373757	Destroy that target!
1373758	Destroy them.
1373759	Die, heretics!
1373760	Fire!
1373761	Focus your hate upon the Xenos!
1373763	Open fire!
1373764	To the attack!
1373765	To victory!
1373766	Show them fury!
1373767	Slay the heretics!
1373768	Stamp them out.
1373769	Strike true!
1373770	Target the Greenskins.
1373771	Target those Greenskins.
1373772	Part the daemons from their flesh!
1373773	Purge that monstrosity.
1373774	Purge the alien.
1373775	Purge the enemy!
1373776	To victory.
1373777	To war!
1373778	Forward!  For the Emperor!
1373779	Eliminate the heretic!
1373780	Feel the Emperor's wrath.
1373781	Feel the might of the righteous!
1373782	Rain fire upon us and we shall return it.
1373783	I will see that thing dead.
1373785	Carry the Emperor's will as your torch; with it destroy the shadows.
1373786	To admit defeat is to blaspheme against the Emperor.
1373787	There is only the Emperor, and he is our shield and protector. 
1373789	Better crippled in body than corrupt in mind.
1373790	If a job is worth doing, it is worth dying for.
1373791	Pain is an illusion of the senses, despair an illusion of the mind. 
1373798	Only in death does duty end.
1373806	A mind without purpose will wander in dark places.
1373809	Success is measured in blood; yours or your enemy's.
1373811	The blood of martyrs is the seed of the Imperium.
1373812	Examine your thoughts.
1373813	Serve the Emperor today, tomorrow you may be dead.
1373814	It is better to die for the Emperor than to live for yourself.
1373815	Heresy grows from idleness.
1373816	Life is the Emperor's currency, spend it well.
1373927	Even in death, I am victorious.
1373928	I die for my brothers and my Emperor.
1373929	I shall fight on...
1373930	I will not know defeat.
1373931	My brothers will avenge me...
1373932	Victory in death.
1373933	If this is to be my last, so be it.
1373936	My Lords... forgive my lapse in showing the proper respect
1373939	The Sergeant
1373953	Leandros!
1373959	Well met, brothers.
1373961	All I have for you is death
1373962	Aye, Lieutenant.
1373963	And even better, our Ultramarines battle brothers are on route.
1373964	The seal of the Inquisition.
1373965	Interesting.
1373966	An experimental weapon...? 
1373967	We still need to deal with this crane.
1373968	Worry not, Captain...
1373969	...I've saved some Orks for you.
1373970	The Orks have got that gun well defended, no mistake.
1373971	This day's getting interesting.
1373972	Millions more of them...
1373973	The Power Source conducts Warp energies?
1373974	...<static - get> a hold of that Inquisitor. We need...
1373975	...<static - It takes more than that> to kill the Captain. Keep looking...
1373976	<static - Captain> Titus, respond. Sidonus to Titus, do you read Captain?
1373977	<static - Still> no response. Keep moving.
1373978	No. He escaped the fall altogether.
1373979	Captain Titus, come in.
1373980	But would you believe I picked up Imperial Guard comm traffic -- from ground-based forces?
1373981	Impressive, to be sure.
1373982	There’s a destroyed monument up ahead --
1373983	Understood.
1373984	Clearing this place will take days.
1373985	Titus, if they take over the Manufactorum, we will have a damnable time getting them out.
1373986	Damn that Drogan.
1373987	This fortress is swarming with Orks.
1373988	Put those in the right place, and this whole fortress will come down.
1373989	We need those explosives, Captain.
1373990	Shell storage is below.
1373991	They are not about to run short of ammunition.
1373992	Argh. The Orks have pulled it out of sequence.
1373993	And up it goes.
1373994	We would be better off seeing this fortress detonate from the outside.
1373995	These Greenskins have certainly made themselves comfortable.
1373996	I will be glad to be done with that thing.
1373997	As quickly as I can.
1373998	Damned Orks shot me off course.
1373999	I’ve had no word from Leandros. 
1374000	No more than six minutes.
1374001	Less than four minutes.
1374002	Captain- do you read me?
1374003	I am facing a pile of Orks killed by bolter fire.
1374004	And we did not do the shooting.
1374005	Clever of the damned Orks. 
1374006	This is your plan? 
1374007	And here is our entrance.
1374008	Open a door, look in the room.
1374009	We should be nearing an access point to the surface.
1374010	The air smells a bit cleaner.
1374011	That many new Orks going after the Titans...
1374012	Set to eliminate Orks?
1374013	Eliminate those turrets!
1374014	We need to shut them all down.
1374015	We had better do so quickly.
1374016	This place will be awash with Orks before long.
1374017	Wrong door!
1374018	What is this thing doing still running?
1374019	I’d admire their tenacity if servitors had any free will.
1374020	Inquisitor -- are you all right?
1374021	You think his injury’s getting to him?
1374022	I will keep two.
1374023	You do not sound confident.
1374024	Unreliable experimental weaponry...
1374025	So, a daemon killed Inquisitor Drogan and then possessed his body.
1374026	Make your point, Leandros.
1374027	We need to keep moving.
1374028	We need to get this gantry in place.
1374029	We need to move through this wreckage.
1374030	The Traitor Legions.
1374031	Renegade militiamen, most likely.
1374032	Traitors ahead.
1374033	Are you injured, Lieutenant? 
1374034	If it gets much larger, Nemeroth can bring his fleet through. 
1374035	You have a plan.
1374036	A smart tactic.
1374037	We will hold the line, Captain.
1374038	Excellent news, Captain.
1374039	It channels Warp energy.
1374040	The liberation fleet has entered the system.
1374041	I’ve got the rendezvous coordinates.
1374042	Ork rocket-fire!
1374043	Hostile artillery!
1374044	Considerate of the green scum to open the way.
1374045	Sow terror.
1374046	Demoralize the militia.
1374047	Ork rocket launchers on the high ground.
1374048	Greenskins incoming!
1374049	Rok impact!
1374050	Keep looking; there is a way forward.
1374051	We need an exit.
1374052	This facility is coming apart.
1374053	Down this way!
1374054	Bad enough thinking these Orks would loot the Titan for weapons.
1374055	But these Chaos traitors could turn the war machine to their cause.
1374056	There it is.
1374057	Captain, we aren’t far from the plaza where Lieutenant Mira was headed -- the Imperial Guard rally point.
1374058	Meaning, what is all this? 
1374059	Specimens, cages, operating theatres...
1374060	Leandros, you do the Chapter proud.
1374061	Through here, Titus.
1374062	Some malfunctioning Servitor, no doubt.
1374063	We had best smash these controls, or the Orks will start this all over again.
1374064	Get across that gantry before the Titan smashes through!
1374065	Hurry! Get across!
1374066	Get to the next lift!
1374067	Back across and you can get to the shoulder.
1374070	Head up the lifts, Titus!
1374071	Colder than a Space Wolf’s smile in here.
1374072	All the lever-pulling is up to you, Captain.
1374073	Cut off the head of a beast, and his claws are not so much of an issue. 
1374074	Hah. Not before having a word or two with the Orks. 
1374075	A lot of Orks.
1374076	They've seen us, Captain.
1401712	They’re after the experimental device --
1401713	I’ve drawn them off, but now I’m trapped.
1401714	...If I die, you must keep the device out of enemy hands, or he'll be unstoppable...
1401715	The weapon was nearly ready...
1401716	...I am Drogan.
1401717	How are you still alive?
1401718	You held raw energy from the Warp...
1401719	My work against the Xenos has the Imperium's blessing.
1401720	The Imperium forbids its use without sanction.
1401721	It could destroy the Orks.
1401722	If it malfunctions, it could crack this planet in half.
1401723	I have served you well, Lord Nemeroth.
1401724	...this is Inquisitor Drogan. 
1401725	I need urgent assistance at Manufactorum Ajakis. 
1401726	The device is safe for the time being -– 
1401727	I needed more time. 
1401728	You were exposed to the unshielded Power Source... 
1401729	My research is of the utmost secrecy. 
1401730	Very well. 
1401731	The Power Source fuels an experimental weapon at my research facility -- the Psychic Scourge. 
1401732	The decoupling procedure must be strictly followed, step by step. 
1401733	I’ll guide you through it. 
1401734	Now comes the most delicate step.
1401735	I will ready the canister from this console, while you slowly turn the dial to your left to move the power source.
1401736	Slowly, now... begin.
1401737	I can manage --
1401738	Give the Power Source to the Sergeant, then, Captain.
1401739	Yes, of course.
1401740	A waste of time.
1401741	We must get to the generator room.
1401742	In the generator room -- I saw it! 
1401743	The Psychic Scourge has never been test-fired, Sergeant.
1401744	And you are...?
1401745	I am soldier and scientist both, Captain.
1401746	Ultramarines - use that control station to open the way.
1401747	You must access the controls.
1401748	Use that console to create a bridge, Captain.
1401749	I shall use the controls to open the way, Ultramarines.
1401750	Hold here while I manipulate the required controls.
1401751	Wait a moment, Captain, and I will have things in place.
1401752	I am afraid I cannot open the way alone.
1401753	Ah, yes. Here we are.
1401754	Yes. A by-product of the device’s functioning. 
1401755	Yes... everything seems in order...
1401756	No, no. 
1401757	We need only obtain the power source at the core of the generator.
1401758	I am a psyker.
1401759	My psychic abilities are controlling the bleeding.
1401760	Not difficult, but complicated.
1401761	<roar of anger>
1401762	The Power Source?
1401763	It's running the entire Manufactorum from the generator room.
1401764	It is a complex device -- and an unstable one.
1401765	This way.
1401766	If the Orks find it, they'll try and take it apart --
1401767	It could detonate with enough force to destroy the entire planet.
1401768	And for that, Captain, I need your aid.
1401769	Safety protocols are blocking access to the generator room.
1401770	With your assistance we can gain entry.
1401771	They will find a way!
1401772	Yes - yes. 
1401773	Transfer weapons control to my position.
1401774	But first, I take vengeance on those who murdered my battle brothers.
1401775	It's time we use the power source to our advantage: to supercharge Invictus.
1401776	Two.
1401777	The scouts have returned to forward base.
1401778	Lieutenant! 
1401779	Aye, Lieutenant!
1401780	My lord, you have saved us.
1401781	Follow the trench network to the Lieutenant’s command bunker. 
1401783	We would be, my lord, if not for the Lieutenant.
1401785	At the front lines. 
1401786	Captain Titus - I need a gunner to man the heavy bolter.
1401787	Captain! 
1401788	Ork ship coming up! 
1401789	Starboard side!
1401790	It’s breaking into the cockpit!
1401791	Get fire on that Ork!
1401792	They’re flanking us!
1401793	My lord Space Marine...
1401794	Ork fire brought our Valkyrie down.
1401795	We survived the crash, but this place is swarming with the creatures... 
1401796	Orks from the North!
1401797	Enemies from the South!
1401798	Coming from the East!
1401799	Targets to the West!
1401800	Orks on the Left!
1401801	To the Right!
1401802	Left flank!
1401803	Keep firing!
1401804	We need support!
1401805	Our position is under heavy assault!
1401806	My lord. . . We owe you our lives.
1401807	Of- of course, my lord.
1401808	It is swarming with the beasts.
1401809	Marsis Plaza is just past this hab complex.
1401810	How... How can we face them...
1401811	The Legions of Chaos...
1401812	Yes, ma'am.
1401813	YES MA'AM!
1401814	Well met, Mira! 
1401815	They’d spit me right out...
1401817	We’ve seen minimal enemy activity.
1401818	But I don't know the status of the other platoons. 
1401819	The Emperor’s Angels of Death fight with us!
1401820	The Adeptus Astartes are here!
1401821	Space Marines! Thank the Emperor!
1401822	More Greenskins!
1401823	Keep firing! Keep firing!
1401824	Why won’t it die?!
1401825	For the Regiment!
1401826	Die you bloody heretic!
1401827	Daemons! Daemons!
1401828	The Emperor Protects!
1401829	Where are they all coming from?!
1401830	Fifth platoon to Primus Command! 
1401831	The Emperor Protects.
1401832	Aye, my lord.
1401833	Your shots won’t penetrate Valkyrie armor, but they’ll cut right through soft targets.
1401834	They were on us almost immediately.
1401835	That seems the last of them, my lord.
1401836	Yes, my lord.
1401837	This is Corporal Antioch, sir ... That is, my lord... 
1401838	Did you drop that cargo on the Orks? 
1401839	There is a service lift in the hangar directly below where you dropped the cargo, my lord.
1401840	We can meet you there.
1401841	Yes, my lord.
1401842	I will show you the way inside.
1401843	Has the Liberation Fleet arrived, my lord?
1401844	I see.
1401845	Yes - Lord Drogan.
1401846	He was of great aid when we cut the main rail bridge.
1401847	I- I do not know, my lord.
1401848	We have not seen him in several days.
1401849	All I can say for certain is that no Ork has breached this gate, my lord.
1401850	I know, my lord.
1401851	What of the Colonel and his staff?
1401852	Here we are, my lord.
1401853	Lieutenant Mira? 
1401854	Thanks, Valkyrie Two!
1401855	I mean -- Lieutenant Mira.
1401856	We won't, Lieutenant.
1401857	Affirmative.
1401858	Already loaded, sir.
1401859	Here they come! Starboard side!
1401860	More Stormboyz!
1401861	That was close!
1401862	Valkyrie Seven here! I’ve got boarders!
1401863	Affirmative.
1401864	[scream]
1401865	Trying, sir.
1401866	Valkyrie Three clear!
1401867	Losing control!
1401868	[scream]
1401869	Valkyrie Six free and clear!
1401870	Thanks!
1401871	[scream]
1401872	They’re right behind us!
1401873	Port side!
1401874	My Lords... forgive my lapse in showing the proper respect
1402076	Got him.
1402077	Good kill, Captain.
1402078	One less traitor.
1402079	Traitors be damned.
1402080	That got him.
1402081	Fast work, Captain.
1402082	Damned traitor.
1402083	Good kill.
1402084	That is the way.
1402085	Impressive.
1402086	He got what he deserved.
1402087	Nicely done, Titus.
1402088	Good kill.
1402089	Excellent.
1402090	One less Ork.
1402091	That has done it, Captain.
1402092	Impressive.
1402093	Damned Ork.
1402094	One less Greenskin.
1402095	Well done.
1402096	Fast work, Captain.

1402189	Thank you, Titus.
1402190	They will answer for that.
1402191	They will have to do better.
1402192	Time for vengeance.

1402324	Being overrun!

1403095	To me, Ultramarines!

1403104	Captain, help me!
1403105	My thanks, Captain
1403106	I can go on now.

1403142	Chaos Renegades!
1403143	Destroy the traitors!
1403144	Don't let the traitors escape!

1403147	Chaos Space Marines!
1403148	Chaos...Emperor save us.
1403149	Captain! Chaos Space Marines!
1403150	Unholy warriors!
1403151	Fire all you've got!
1403152	Brace for Chaos attack!
1403153	Chaos is here!

1403163	Watch for the big Ork!
1403164	Orks!
1403165	Greenskins!
1403166	A whole mess of Ork boys
1403167	Here come more Orks
1403168	Orks! More Orks!
1403169	Get those Orks
1403170	More damned Orks!
1403171	Ork horde!
1403172	Take the boys out!
1403173	Ork boys!
1403174	Ork gunner!
1403175	Ork gunner -- watch it!
1403176	Gunner! Keep your head down.
1403177	Ork guns!
1403178	Get that gunner!
1403179	Take out that gunner!
1403180	Silence the Ork gun!
1403181	Ork gun ahead.
1403182	Ork rockets!
1403183	Heads up -- Ork rockets!
1403184	Rocket Ork ahead!
1403185	Rockets!
1403186	Take out the rocket nob.
1403187	Get ready for rocket attack!
1403188	Look out for Ork rockets!
1403189	Rocket Ork!
1403190	I need help, Captain
1403191	Over here, Captain -- hurry
1403192	Damn it...I'm hurt
1403193	I'm hit
1403194	I'm in trouble, Captain
1403195	I can't hold them off!
1403196	There's too many of them!
1403197	Help me, Captain!
1403198	I'm wounded, Captain
1403199	They've got me trapped --
1403200	Thank you, Captain
1403201	I'm ready to fight, Captain
1403202	I'll be fine now
1403203	Point me to the fight
1403204	I hope you left some for me.
1403205	Leandros has fallen!
1403206	They've overwhelmed Leandros
1403207	Leandros needs your help
1403208	They've wounded Leandros
1403210	Sidonus is down!
1403211	Help Sergeant Sidonus!
1403212	Sidonus needs you
1403213	Go to Sidonus!
1403214	The Sergeant needs help
1403245	Battle brothers, fire!
1403246	And we shall know no fear.
1403247	Enemies to the left.
1403248	Enemies to the right.
1403249	Look left.
1403250	Look right.
1403251	On the left.
1403252	On the right.
1403253	Flanking from the left!
1403254	Flanking from the right!
1403255	They’re above us!
1403256	Incoming!
1403257	Sniper!
1403258	Rockets!
1403259	Grenade!
1403260	Low on ammo.
1403261	Out of ammo.
1403262	Now’s our chance.
1403263	Now’s my chance.
1403264	This isn’t working.
1403265	It has a force field.
1403266	Force field down.
1403267	Dropship incoming!
1403268	Incoming dropship.
1403269	Enemy sighted.
1403270	In the pipes!
1403271	Diggas!
1403272	A servo skull.
1403273	What is that.
1403274	It won’t open.
1403275	It’s not working.
1410369	Sniper!
1410371	Under fire!
1410372	Taking damage!
1410373	Orks!
1410375	Daemons!
1410376	Traitors!
1410377	Chaos!
1410379	Warp portal!

1410385	Incoming !
1410386	Incoming fire!

1424682	There are too many!
1424683	Under fire!
1424684	We lost one!
1432277	-- just get the ship out of orbit, pilot.
1432278	Lieutenant Mira!
1432279	The Orks cut off our reinforcements.
1432280	Damn it --
1432281	I suggest we move the unit to a more defensible position, sir.
1432282	Do it. 
1432283	And make sure -- 
1432286	-- not enough cover --
1432287	Get down, get down!
1432288	<agonizing scream>
1432289	Hold on, Captain! 
1432290	Get me a medi-pack!
1432291	It won’t help.
1432295	-- we’re all going to die out here --
1432296	You are an Imperial Guardsman.
1432297	Start acting like one!
1432298	But, Lieutenant --
1432299	We’re not dead yet!
1432300	So do your bloody job and defend the line before they -- 
1432304	Let’s go. 
1432305	You’re not leading this raid?
1432306	Of course I am.
1432307	Lieutenant, we need you in one piece. 
1432308	Let’s face it -- you’re holding us together out here, and if you get --
1432311	-- still don’t think this is a good idea. 
1432312	It’s not your call, is it?
1432313	I say this is our best chance of taking the gun.
1432314	But a nighttime assault?
1432315	Have some faith, Sampson.
1432316	In the dark we might catch those Orks off their guard.
1432317	Unless they’ve --
1432319	Encoded transmission from Inquisitor Drogan to Inquisitor lord Sharpe.
1432320	As we'd hoped, my lord, Forge World Graia is an ideal location to focus on my work.  
1432321	Though helpful, the techpriests of the Adeptus Mechanicus are forever curious.  
1432322	Interest can easily turn to interference... 
1432323	I will be cautious about involving them in my experiments.
1432324	At least, for now.
1432325	Transmission to Inquisitor Lord Sharpe--
1432326	My lord: the research facility is operational ahead of schedule, thanks to the techpriests.
1432327	I’ve already begun my work to create a stable energy matrix. 
1432328	Harnessing these...unorthodox ...energies is proving more promising than I could have dreamed.... 
1432329	Report to Lord Sharpe--
1432330	The Fabricator-General of Graia shares my vision for the Power Source. 
1432331	Today, he offered up the Titan Manufactorum to test the device's capabilities. 
1432332	There is a risk that the Power Source may overload and destroy the entire facility.
1432333	But it is an acceptable risk. 
1432334	And the techpriest does not need to know.
1432335	To Lord Sharpe--
1432336	The Power Source succeeded in fueling the entire Titan Manufactorum -- a remarkable feat.
1432337	But I have not forgotten my true purpose on Graia, my lord.
1432338	I have dedicated my life to defeating the alien horde. 
1432339	Now, I will use the Power Source in a weapon that exploits the very weaknesses of our alien foe....
1432340	To Lord Sharpe--
1432341	The weapon is working.  
1432342	Integrating the Power Source makes this weapon far more devastating to the alien biology than I'd envisioned. 
1432343	My lord: I believe that this weapon -- this psychic scourge -- could end the alien threat against the Imperium for all time.
1432344	The Adeptus Astartes...
1432345	The door is barricaded, my lords!
1432346	I believe they will let us through.
1432347	Imperial Guard!
1432348	We are Ultramarines.
1432349	Open this door!
1432351	Space Marines, here?
1432352	The Angels of Death!
1432353	We're saved...
1432355	Captain-
1432356	Frag Grenades.
1432357	Marcus reports heavy losses at his position, Lieutenant!
1432358	Send reinforcements.
1432359	Now.
1432360	Right away, ma'am!
1432361	Lieutenant! 
1432362	We can't raise Outpost Delta.
1432363	Take Willem and see what's going on.
1432364	Very carefully.
1432365	Yes, Lieutenant.
1432366	Running low on ammunition, Lieutenant!
1432367	Send a runner to the depot at Position Alpha.
1432368	Lieutenant --
1432369	The Orks shot down Lucan's Valkyrie!
1432370	Damn it! 
1432371	Keep the other birds on the ground.
1432372	This way, my lords.
1432373	Captain, this way.
1432374	Follow me, my lords.
1432375	Please follow me, Captain.
1432376	Those Orks did a good job smashing that Rok into the gun complex.
1432377	That's the purpose of using a hollowed-out asteroid for a landing craft.
1432378	We'll probably find it still full of Orks.
1432380	<chuckle>
1432383	Once we get through these battlements, we will use the breach caused by the Rok to enter the gun fortress.
1432384	What was that thing trying to loot?
1432385	A jump pack.
1432386	The Emperor provides.
1432387	We are pinned down, Captain!
1432388	Under heavy fire!
1432389	Under fire and pinned down!
1432390	Destroy those Ork gunners!
1432391	Here is the Rok, at last.
1432392	No point looking for a doorway into the fortress.
1432393	No, we go through.
1432394	The way is blocked--
1432395	No.
1432396	There is a path...
1432397	Very narrow.
1432398	No room for that jump pack, Captain.
1432399	Better to remove it now.
1432400	Out of fuel.
1432401	Captain, this is an augur station.
1432402	I can scan for the Inquisitor's life signs.
1432403	The station is reporting very few survivors. . .
1432404	There -- a lone human.
1432405	He's in this wing of the manufactorum.
1432406	But much further in.
1432407	Captain --
1432408	I read alien signals throughout the facility.
1432409	And a large number converging on the Inquisitor's location.
1432410	Orks.
1432411	They found another way in.
1432413	These crates take the fast route through the factory.
1432414	We need to activate the conveyor.
1432415	If we get a crate onto the belt, it should start up automatically.
1432416	Follow the crate.
1432417	It will trigger the doors.
1432418	Xenos life forms detected.
1432419	Sealing room.
1432420	Xenos presence remains.
1432421	Lockdown in effect.
1432422	Xenos destroyed.
1432423	Releasing safeguards.
1432424	There --
1432425	We must get to that lift.
1432426	And only a handful of Orks stand in our way.
1432427	Are you questioning my authority, Sergeant?
1432428	Enough.
1432429	We clear the chamber.
1440175	Do not abandon your work station.
1440176	Everything is under control.
1440177	Hard work occupies the body and distracts the mind.
1440178	It is a noble and worthy thing.
1440179	Quotas must be met, despite alien incursions.
1440180	Delinquency is an affront to the Machine God.
1440181	The Machine God is watching.
1440182	Dutiful work gains his favor.
1440183	Section four four nine is  understaffed by one hundred per cent.
1440184	Please rectify.
1440185	Be not concerned with events beyond these walls.
1440186	Work...focus...meet your quota.
1440187	Increased productivity gains high favor from the Machine God. 
1440188	When you die, you will be replaced.
1440189	Rejoice that your work will outlive you.
1440190	This section reports five thousand, three hundred and two workers absent.
1440191	The Magos has been notified.
1440192	Take pride in your work.
1440193	Injury or illness must not affect quality or quota.
1440194	Worker absence is unacceptable. Transgressors face severe remedial training.
1440195	You belong to the Machine God.
1440196	You are a cog in the glorious machine. 
1440197	Imminent failure on levels twelve and above.
1440198	Stand by for instructions.
1440199	An armory of the Adeptus Mechanicus.
1440200	Captain-- An armory.
1440201	There will be weapons in that armory.
1440202	This Armory is still intact.
1440203	The Greenskins have jammed this lift as well.
1440204	If we can get around, we can dislodge the obstruction.
1440205	A solid heave should get this out of the way.
1440206	Now back to the lift.
1455762	-- lock it down!
1455763	A daemon is in the labs!
1455764	Authorization required to implement security protocols.
1455765	Drogan.
1455766	Inquisitor, Ordo Xenos.
1455767	You can’t run, human!
1455768	Repeat authorization.
1455769	Speak clearly.
1455770	Drogan!
1455771	Inquisitor, Ordo --
1455774	-- detects no life signals within.
1455775	Adjust scan for daemonic signatures.
1455776	Results unchanged.
1455777	The daemon broke out of the lab --
1455778	Reading daemonic signals in interstitial level two-four-four.
1455779	Prepare the Power Source for immediate release.
1455780	Disregard all safety protocols and --
1455783	-- complete the integration sequence.
1455784	Power source successfully integrated.
1455785	Manufactorum systems drawing ten percent power.
1455786	Thirteen...
1455787	New function required: scan exterior for daemonic signals.
1455788	One moment.
1455789	Faster.
1455790	Daemonic signature detected in Habitation Center Andris.
1455791	Quickly -- prepare transmission, encoded Imperial access only and --
1455794	The Warp device!
1455795	Where is it?
1455796	Safe from you, daemon!
1455797	You will tell me. 
1455798	After you are dead!
1455799	<monstrous scream>
1455800	<agonized scream>
1455802	<daemonic chanting>
1455803	<yell of pain>
1455804	-- in Nemeroth’s name --
1455805	I possess this corpse.
1455806	I possess this Inquisitor.
1455807	I possess his secrets!
1455808	The Warp device...
1455809	...is here!
1455810	So close! 
1455811	But how can I get to--
1480473	Adeptus Astartes recognized.
1480474	Access authorized.
1480475	Space Marine recognized.
1480476	Ultramarines chapter.
1480477	Granting access.
1480478	Authorization Astartes Ultra.
1480479	The Emperor be with you, Space Marine.
1480480	Weapons authorization confirmed.
1480481	Access granted.
1480482	Genetic scan complete - Adeptus Astartes.
1480483	Full access granted.
1480484	The Emperor’s Angels of Death fight with us!
1480485	The Adeptus Astartes are here!
1480486	Space Marines! Thank the Emperor!
1480487	More Greenskins!
1480488	Keep firing! Keep firing!
1480489	Why won’t it die?!
1480490	For the Regiment!
1480491	Die you bloody heretic!
1480492	Daemons! Daemons!
1480493	The Emperor Protects!
1480494	Where are they all coming from?!
1480495	Guard down!
1480496	I’m hit!
1480497	Incoming!
1480498	Man down!
1480499	Reloading !
1480500	Taking damage!
1480501	There are too many!
1480502	Under fire!
1480503	We lost one!
1480504	The Adeptus Astartes...
1480505	Space Marines, here?
1480506	We're saved...
1480507	Aye, Lieutenant!
1480508	Marcus reports heavy losses at his position, Lieutenant!
1480509	Right away, ma'am!
1480510	Lieutenant! 
1480511	We can't raise Outpost Delta.
1480512	Yes, Lieutenant.
1480513	Running low on ammunition, Lieutenant!
1480514	Left flank!
1480515	Keep firing!
1480516	We need support!
1480517	Fifth platoon to Primus Command! 
1480518	Our position is under heavy assault!
1480519	My lord. . . We owe you our lives.
1480520	Of- of course, my lord.
1480521	The Emperor Protects.
1480522	Aye, my lord.
1480523	Marsis Plaza is just past this hab complex.
1480524	It is swarming with the beasts.
1480525	Affirmative.
1480526	Captain Titus - I need a gunner to man the heavy bolter.
1480527	Already loaded, sir.
1480528	Your shots won’t penetrate Valkyrie armor, but they’ll cut right through soft targets.
1480529	Here they come! Starboard side!
1480530	More Stormboyz!
1480531	That was close!
1480532	Valkyrie Seven here! I’ve got boarders!
1480533	Affirmative.
1480534	Thanks, Valkyrie Two!
1480535	<scream>
1480536	Trying, sir.
1480537	Valkyrie Three clear!
1480538	Losing control!
1480539	<scream>
1480540	Valkyrie Six free and clear!
1480541	Thanks!
1480542	<scream>
1480543	Captain! 
1480544	Starboard side!
1480545	Ork ship coming up! 
1480546	They’re right behind us!
1480547	Port side!
1480548	It’s breaking into the cockpit!
1480549	Get fire on that Ork!
1480550	They’re flanking us!

1480561	YES MA'AM!
1480562	-- still don’t think this is a good idea. 
1480563	But a nighttime assault?

1480596	Fifth platoon to Primus Command! 
1480597	Our position is under heavy assault!
1480598	My lord. . . We owe you our lives.
1480599	Of- of course, my lord.
1480600	The Emperor Protects.
1480601	Aye, my lord.
1480602	Marsis Plaza is just past this hab complex.
1480603	It is swarming with the beasts.
1480604	Affirmative.
1480605	Captain Titus - I need a gunner to man the heavy bolter.
1480606	Already loaded, sir.
1480607	Your shots won’t penetrate Valkyrie armor, but they’ll cut right through soft targets.
1480608	Here they come! Starboard side!
1480609	More Stormboyz!

1532426	This is Captain Titus.
1532427	What is the status of the Titan?
1532428	My crew and I are aboard Invictus, but she is immobilized.
1532430	If you can release our mooring clamps, we can bring devastation to the invaders.
1532431	You will need to activate our berth’s backup generator to release the mooring clamps.
1532432	The renegades have it well guarded.
1532433	That elevator will get us to the mooring clamp controls.
1532434	I will take care of the clamps.
1532435	You and Leandros get the doors to the Manufactorum open.
1532436	Understood, Captain.
1532437	Enoch -- I have a target for you: the Orbital Spire.
1532438	The spire...
1532439	But Captain, it is a masterwork of the Machine God...
1532440	It is feeding energy into the Warp Gate above it.
1532441	If we are to stop this invasion, the spire must fall.
1532442	I understand.
1532443	That did it, Ultramarines!
1532444	Mooring clamps released.
1532445	Invictus powering up now.
1532446	My battle brothers will have the gates open shortly.
1532447	Maneuver Invictus close to the topmost gantries.
1532448	I am coming aboard.
1532449	What--?
1532450	Yes, Captain.
1532451	Enoch, I have Inquisitor Drogan’s power source with me.
1532452	We must use it to supercharge your weaponry.
1532453	The power source?
1532454	The rites involved in using it safely...
1532455	Only the High Fabricator himself--
1532458	Unless we act now, an entire Chaos fleet will hang over your Forge World.
1532459	Understood.
1532461	Where must I bring the power source?
1532462	Travel across the armature to the starboard side, Captain.
1532463	I will open a maintenance apse for the volcano cannon.
1532464	Captain, there is a coupling near the apse console.
1532465	It should be able to accommodate the Inquisitor’s device.
1532466	Ugh.
1532467	Omnissiah preserve us...
1532468	The power levels are astonishing.
1532470	We must hurry, Captain.
1532471	The feedback through my control matrix is substantial.
1532472	Awaiting your command, Captain.
1532473	Target acquired.
1532474	Fire!
1532476	Captain...
1532477	All systems are overloading...
1532478	Did it work?
1532479	Invictus performed admirably, Enoch.
1532480	The Warp Gate is closing.
1532481	Thank the Machine-God.
1532482	Head down the walkways to the gun level, Captain.
1532483	Leap down to the walkways around the volcano cannon, Captain.
1532484	Activating a lift for you, Captain.
1532485	You need to head up, Captain.
1532486	You need to head down, Captain.
1532487	Head for the port side.
1532488	Head to the starboard side, Captain.
1532489	Move toward the head, Ultramarine.
1532490	Away from the Titan’s head, Captain Titus.
1532491	Doors opening now.
1532492	The apse is above you, Captain.
1532493	The apse is below you, Captain.
1558825	A human crashed here!

1558854	That's Inquisitor Drogan!
1558855	Inquisitor Drogan's alive!
1558856	I can't believe we survived that...
1558857	I can't believe we survived that...
1558858	Which route to the rally point, guardsman?
1558859	Bastion Primus is that way, my lord.
1558860	But it's all Ork-held territory.
1558861	Bastion Primus is that way, my lord.

1576847	Captain Titus, proceed into the main chamber.
1576848	I will initiate decoupling from a control console.
1576849	The containment systems are being stubborn, Captain.
1576850	I need you to manually disengage the two locking fixtures.
1576851	Forcibly, if you must.
1576852	Move to the other fixture, Captain.
1576853	Hurry.
1576854	I have engaged the decoupling sequence, Captain.
1576855	But it will take some time.
1576856	You must keep the chamber secure until the power source is exposed.
1576857	Hold back the Greenskins, Captain.
1576858	The power source will be free of the generator shortly.
1576859	How will we transport this power source, Inquisitor?
1576860	There are several of the canisters in the chamber.
1576861	Hurry, Captain!
1576862	Get to the center and place the power source in its canister.
1576863	Plasma will get through that armor!
1576864	Titus! Deploy that plasma gun!
1576866	Identity confirmed: Drogan. Ordo Xenos.
1576867	Access granted.
1576868	Warning - Manufactorum power disengaging.

1585903	Supply post nine, report your situation immediately.
1585904	Supply post fifteen, do you require reinforcements?
1585905	Sir, I can't get through to Supply posts six or eight.
1585906	If there's anyone at supply post eleven, respond.
1585907	No word from the Valkyrie wings, sir.
1585908	Outpost delta missed its scheduled call-in.
1585909	Outpost delta, report!
1585910	Come in, outpost delta!
1585911	Outpost Gamma reports heavy bombardment.
1585912	Ork attack at Outpost Gamma!
1585913	Gamma here -- we'll be out of ammunition by nightfall.
1585914	Send any ammo you can spare.
1585915	Hurry!
1585916	Outpost gamma urgently requires munitions, sir.
1585917	Scouts report sector thirty one is completely bombed out.
1585918	No survivors...just bodies. 
1585919	Everywhere
1585920	We've found another mass grave on the factory outskirts.
1585921	The distress call stopped transmitting. 
1585922	We're still going to check it out -- maybe there's survivors.
1585923	We're pushing further into Atreus hab block.
1585924	Only bodies so far. 
1585925	No survivors.
1585926	Negative, sir. 
1585927	The techpriest died during transport.
1585928	The damned Orks have slaughtered everyone here!
1585929	We're at the creche. 
1585930	All the children...
1585931	I can't do this...
1585932	We're continuing our sweep of Habitation block Atreus.
1585933	The Orks have ripped through this place.
1585934	We've found the source of the explosion, sir.
1585935	The Orks blew up the fuel dump.
1585936	We're at the evacuation centre.
1585937	They're all dead.
1585938	All of them.
1585939	The evac centre's been blown sky high, sir.
1585940	We're at the medic center.
1585941	There's no one inside. 
1585942	Just piles of bodies outside the walls.
1585943	Scouts reporting zero survivors at evac center epsilon.
1585944	It's getting bad out here.
1585945	We've got to start burning the bodies, sir, before disease spreads.
1585946	You heard the orders!
1585947	Burn the bodies.
1585948	Reports confirmed -- the Orks threw bodies into the hab center cisterns.
1585949	Follow protocol and purify your water. 
1585950	We're cut off -- send troops to sector fifteen!
1585951	Get us some help!
1585952	Our flank has collapsed -- they're breaking through!
1585953	Keep the right flank solid.
1585954	We'll focus fire on the big Ork.
1585955	Valkyrie seven, report in!
1585956	The signal from the forward scouting party is overdue.

1604173	All the children...
1604174	I can't do this...
1613315	Using an asteroid for a landing craft...
1686481	That seems the last of them my lord
1695633	Where are they coming from
1695634	The Adeptus Astartes
1695635	of-of course, my lord.
1695636	It's swarming with the beasts.
1695637	That seems the last of them my lord
1713950	Using an asteroid for a landing craft...
1723108	Leandros is under attack!
1723109	Ork Boyz
1723110	Just get the damned 
1723111	-- short bursts, conserve your ammo.
1732275	I want this one's head.
1732276	Your all gonna die!
1759776	Never trust the inquisition!
1778115	Move move move!
1778116	We need those damn medi-packs!
1778118	Digga! DIGGA!
1778119	Form a damn firing line!
1778120	Open fire as soon as the doors swing down!
1778123	My thanks.
1778124	These damn machines usually lead up a charge, though.
1778126	Flankers!
1778127	Coming over the far wall!
1778130	Incoming artillery!
1778132	Why isn't anyone on this weapon?
1778135	We're heading back to the command post, Captain.
1778136	The Orks hold the trenches beyond the ruins, and the battlements beyond that.
1778137	Good luck.
1778138	The Ork lines.
1778139	They are downright comfortable.
1778140	It is time for that to change.
1778142	Look at these cables...
1778143	They must be powering Ork contraptions across the battlefield.
1778144	Orks on high!
1778145	Get to that ledge, Captain.
1778146	Take to the high ground, Captain.
1778147	We will deal with Orks down here.
1778148	Look.
1778149	That rok delivered the Orks right into the gun fortress.
1778150	Madness.
1787357	Get me that field manual!
1787358	Stuck on bloody Forge World and not a single Techpriest in sight!
1787359	Power pack's dead; won't hold a charge.
1787360	Can't keep the dust out of this thing...
1787361	Oy! Keep that muzzle clean, Guardsman!
1787362	<dull moan of pain>
1787363	What... no... get off... 
1787364	God-Emperor... watch over those who fight in your name...
1787365	Where's the damn medi-pack?
1787366	My legs-- I can't feel my legs...
1787367	I got to see a Space Marine before the end...
1787368	Damn Gretchin stuck a knife in Saul's throat two nights ago.
1787369	You know what I want more than anything?
1787370	The bloody Ultramarines to stride in and save our miserable lives...
1787371	Word from the Second Recce--
1787372	Another horde of the Greenskins are headed here from the south.
1787374	Kill the psyker!
1787376	That psyker is keeping the portal open.
1787377	Destroy him!
1787378	This way, Ultramarines.
1787379	This way.
1787380	Please follow, Captain.
1787381	Follow me, Space Marines.
1787382	This way.
1787383	Through here, Captain.
1787384	Here's the way.
1787385	Over here, Captain.
1787386	The path is this way.
1787387	Captain, this way.
1787388	Here, Captain.
1787389	We are headed this way.
1787390	We can go this way.
1787391	Over here, Space Marines.
1787392	Captain Titus - this way.
1787393	Through here.
1787394	This way, Captain.
1787395	The lift is this way.
1787396	Titus. The lift is here.
1787397	We need to get to that lift.
1787398	We should use the lift, Captain.
1787399	This way to the lift.
1787400	Gather on the lift.
1787401	Captain - this way.
1787402	We can use this lift.
1787403	There's a lift over here.
1787404	To the lift.
1787405	We all need to get on that lift.
1787406	Gather on the lift, Ultramarines.
1787407	We use that lift, Captain.
1787408	Follow me to the lift.
1787409	Board the lift, Ultramarines.
1787410	For the Emperor!
1787411	For Ultramar!
1787412	Zeal and Fury!
1787413	No Mercy! No Respite!
1787416	In the grim darkness of the far future...
1787417	There is only war.
1796707	If you'll just wait for me to get into position.
1796708	I'm seeing updrafts, Inquisitor.
1796709	How much deeper does this facility go?
1796710	The Manufactorum? Far deeper.
1796711	The whole generator room is actually suspended above a venting shaft.
1796712	Suspended?
1796713	Yes. In case of catastrophic overload, the whole room can be shunted away into the depths.
1796714	Yes, here we are--
1796715	DAMNABLE THING!
1796716	Where is the first fixture?
1796717	On this side of the chamber.
1796718	Directly in front of me.
1796719	The fixture is over here, Captain.
1796720	Why the delay, Captain?
1796721	You must hurry.
1796722	Come to the fixture, Captain.
1796723	I insist.
1796724	At the opposite end of the chamber.
1796725	Captain! The Warboss!
1796726	Space Marine!
1796727	What you hiding down here?
1796728	Whatever it is, I WANT IT!
1796729	Go get it, boyz!
1796730	That's it! 
1796731	Bring in yer biggest shootas!
1796732	Tear this whole place apart!
1796733	There, the primary shield is open, Captain.
1796734	Head into the central chamber.
1796735	To the command console.
1796737	Head to the console, Captain.
1796738	Trigger the main release.
1796739	That will cause the final layers of shielding to retract.
1796740	Now head over to the Servitor station and activate it.
1796741	It will retrieve the power source and get it into its canister.
1796742	The Servitor!!
1796743	That damn Ork will kill us all!
1796744	Quickly, Inquisitor. 
1796745	What now?
1796746	Grab it, Captain!
1796747	Force the power source into its canister! 
1796748	Before the Orks can take it!
1796749	Captain!
1796750	CAPTAIN!
1796751	Captain Titus, the Orks have massacred the Forge World's forces.
1796752	And they have taken the planetary defense weapons.
1796753	But I'm picking up vox chatter from Imperial Guard forces on the ground.
1796754	I scarcely thought any would be left alive, much less still fighting.
1796755	This way, boyz!
1796756	They got no way out of there!
1796757	Here they come!
1796760	We make for the defense cannon, Captain? 
1796763	Head out the upper level, and continue through the plaza.
1796764	The bunker is beyond that.
1796765	Remarkable. 
1796766	A few hundred against a million Orks. 
1796767	And they fight on.
1796768	"Only in death does duty end."
1796769	Captain--
1796770	I'm in position at a broken monument near the Guard lines.
1796772	There he is.
1796773	That was the ork ship I saw crash near here, I take it.
1796774	Did he survive?
1796775	Through here.
1796776	Where is your commander, Guardsman?
1796777	Inside - but the door is sealed.
1796778	I can radio in...
1796779	At last- a place the Orks have not stained.
1796780	For now. 
1796781	I doubt even dropping that cannon on them will convince Orks to back away.
1796782	Indeed.
1796783	We must find this Inquisitor and the Titan Invictus.
1796784	He sent a distress signal:
1796785	He wants to be found.
1796786	Titan Invictus seems undamaged, at least.
1796787	Titan Invictus seems unused, you mean.
1796788	Is this invasion not enough to bring out the war titans?
1796789	It takes hundreds to get a War Titan operational, Sergeant.
1796790	Without them, it sits idle.
1796792	Leandros, can you use this panel to contact our other forces?
1796793	Not directly, but I can boost vox range.
1796795	Ultramarines, this is Captain Titus.
1796796	Are you receiving?
1796797	Captain. This is Sergeant Midas.
1796801	Squad Solinus is on the ground and making for our objective.
1796802	New orders, Midas.
1796803	We are at Manufactorum Ajakis -- and have located the Titan "Invictus".
1796804	I need Solinus to come secure the Invictus, while I divert to a priority alarm.
1796805	On our way, Captain.
1796806	Midas, out.
1796807	The pipes -- the Orks are in the pipes.
1796811	The Ork himself!
1796814	Aye--
1796815	The Ork has a scent for us now. 
1796816	Damnable creature! 
1796817	Had he not blundered onto this world--
1796818	But he did, Drogan.
1796819	Quickly!
1796820	Across the conveyors!
1796821	Heavy bolter above!
1796822	On the gantry!
1796824	This should help clear out these Orks.
1796826	What madness is this?
1796827	What's that sparky thing you got, human?
1796828	<cackling laughter>
1796829	My boyz want to give you a proper greeting.
1796830	Don't drop my sparky, Space Marine...
1796831	You ain't never going to see the sky again...
1796832	I want it!
1796833	That sparky of yours is calling to me, Space Marine.
1796834	Even here, the Techpriests honor their Machine-God.
1796836	You got a little shoota there, Space Marine?
1796837	Let's see if you can use it!
1796849	<static> ...repeat, this is Midas, from Squad Solinus.
1796850	The Orks have cut me off from my squad and forced me into the sewers. 
1796853	<static>. . . no reply. . . too much interference. . . 
1796854	I am headed for the main reservoir -- there should be an access -- <static>
1796856	That reservoir must be nearby.
1796857	Midas, this is Titus.
1796858	Do you read?
1796859	Captain? 
1796860	One of the Orks did something... 
1796861	I'm hit... 
1796862	<wet cough>
1796863	The bleeding won't stop...
1796864	I'm on my way, Midas!
1796865	Midas!
1796868	Brother Midas from Squad Solinus fought through here.
1796869	He did not survive.
1796870	You broke my shield!
1796871	I'll kill you fer that!
1796872	Can't get me over here, can ya?
1796873	I'm over here, Space Marine!
1796874	What you doing so far away, humie?
1796875	<dazed grunts>
1796876	I can see that sparky in my mind...
1796877	I think I need to rest a little bit...
1796878	Ahhh... yes, YES!
1796879	I'm ALL better, now.
1796880	I'm not dead yet, Space Marine.
1796881	But you are.
1796882	All better now!
1796883	That's better!
1796884	You're dead, Space Marine! Hear me? Dead!
1796885	I'm gonna dance on your skull, human!
1796886	I want that sparky thing of yours!
1796887	The beast has paid, Midas.
1796888	You are avenged.
1796889	The Orks haven't made it through here, it seems.
1796890	An armory. Sure to be something useful.
1796891	Adeptus Astartes recognized. 
1796892	Doors unsealed.
1796893	Space Marine recognized.
1796894	Access to experimental Vengeance Launcher granted.
1796895	A Vengeance Launcher? 
1796896	That sounds promising.
1796897	We need a fast way out.
1796898	Shoot the barrels!
1796899	Shoot the pipes!
1796900	Blow the wall out!
1796901	We can blast an escape through the walls.  Shoot the barrels!
1796902	Shoot the pipes and they'll blast open an escape route!
1796903	There goes the shell.
1796904	The walls are coming down! 
1796905	Move faster, brothers -- we are cutting it close.
1796906	Gun firing.
1796907	Reset for firing sequence.
1796908	Artillery shell moving into position.
1796909	Shell loading.
1796910	Keep clear.
1796911	Firing sequence in progress.
1796912	Gun firing in three. Two. One.
1796913	Firing now.
1796914	Stand clear. 
1796915	Reloading.
1796916	Priming gun battery.
1796917	Access restricted to upper decks.
1796921	Captain Titus?
1796922	We're gathering our wounded and are heading to the Andris Habitation Block to establish an outpost.  
1796923	What do you know of the Titans on this planet?
1796924	Only that some of our troops were sent to guard the Titan "Invictus" at Manufactorum Ajakis.
1796925	But that was two weeks ago, and we've lost contact with them.
1796926	They do everything on a grand scale here.
1796927	Just imagine it as it should be: with thousands of workers and trains going non-stop.
1796928	That would show you the true scale of this place.
1796929	Now, that bridge is a testament to the might of the Imperium.  
1796930	The Adeptus Mechanicus are masterful architects. 
1796931	Their work outlived all of them. 
1796933	Personal message cache; Guardsman Thomas Alexander.
1796934	Must be winter back home. No snow here, that's for certain.
1796935	We've been diverted to a Forge World under Ork attack. 
1796936	The defenders are all dead, the Orks are killing everyone on the planet, and we're the only Imperial Guard in the sector. 
1796937	The fleet's on the way -- but they're a couple of weeks out. 
1796938	We're in for a hard fight.
1796940	Personal message, Guardsman Alexander.
1796941	I'll be quick.
1796942	The Orks are beating us bad. 
1796943	We're completely outnumbered -- every time you kill one of the bastards, feels like a dozen take their place. 
1796944	And my mate Gareth. An Ork chopped his leg off and he bled out -- nothing I could do. 
1796945	The officers are all dead. 
1796946	A second lieutenant's taken over. 
1796947	She's keeping us focused -- 
1796948	Wait -- we're moving out. 
1796949	More soon.
1796950	Personal message cache, Guardsman Alexander.
1796951	Today was a good day.
1796952	We were clearing a foundry of Orks when I heard banging from inside the furnace.
1796953	Good thing I didn't throw a grenade inside, because it was full of civilians - starving, scared, some no more than kids - but still alive.
1796954	It cheered everyone up to see them. 
1796955	Gives us something worth fighting for, you know?
1796956	Now we've just got to keep the Orks away from them.
1796957	I want to be strong -- to say everything's all right, but it's not.
1796958	The dead are everywhere. 
1796959	Stinking, rotting...we burn the bodies when we can, but the fire attracts more Orks.
1796960	If you stop and think about the billions dead here, you'll go mad. 
1796961	But no matter where you go, you find the people of this world...all dead, all waiting for help that never came.
1796962	I moved too slow...got shot in the gut. 
1796963	Stupid of me.
1796964	Doesn't hurt now, though -- the medics gave me something. 
1796965	But they're not stitching me up. 
1796966	I wish they would.
1796967	Is it winter back home?
1796968	Did I ask that? 
1796969	There's something wrong with me. 
1796972	Encrypt recording. 
1796973	Authorization Drogan, Inquisitor Ordo Xenos. 
1796974	I have arrived on Graia to begin my research. 
1796975	This work could change the course of history. 
1796976	I would be a fool to leave no record...the Imperium must not forget the good I have done. 
1796977	But these journals will remain sealed until my death, for here I will speak the truth that could damn me.
1796978	My work began with two simple questions.
1796979	On that day, my ship had just entered the dimensional limbo of the Warp.
1796980	Most people do not like to think of the Warp's true nature. 
1796981	After all, it lets us travel between the stars. 
1796982	But the Warp is the realm of Chaos. 
1796983	Creatures of absolute evil - and absolute power - take their strength directly from it.
1796984	So, I asked my questions: Could I tap into that power? 
1796985	And what could I do with it?
1796986	On that fateful journey through the Warp, in my exhausted musings, I let my guard down...something a psyker should never do. 
1796987	My desire - my psychic will - reached out into the Warp...and the Warp reached back.
1796988	A spark of Warp energy appeared before me. 
1796989	Tentative, flickering, and powerful -- I felt it batter my psychic shields.
1796990	My shock was absolute. 
1796991	I lost focus, and the spark disappeared. 
1796992	I knew I had to get it back.
1796993	With my psychic abilities, I had drawn energy from the Warp.
1796994	If I could summon it again -- contain it, control it -- then perhaps I could use it to defend the Imperium.
1796995	So, I made another interstellar journey through the Warp.
1796996	Barely daring to hope, I lowered my psychic defenses and willed the energy to return.
1796997	And it did. 
1796998	I captured the spark in a containment device, and marvelled at its potential. 
1796999	My work could now begin. 
1797000	With my psychic abilities, I had drawn energy from the Warp.
1797001	I found a planet where I could work, unobserved: a remote Forge World. 
1797002	The Adeptus Mechanicus gave me free reign when I told them I was developing a weapon with a new, 'unorthodox' energy source. 
1797003	They know the Xenos will soon choke humanity out of the galaxy. 
1797004	If my weapon will help keep our species alive, they will not ask questions. 
1797005	Desperation cuts through bureaucracy.
1797006	Experimentation with the Warp energy is proceeding rapidly. 
1797007	I no longer need to travel into the Warp to pull more energy into this dimension.
1797008	But I am encountering ...unexpected...activity.
1797009	I was naive to think that my incursion into Warp space had gone unnoticed. 
1797010	Someone -- some thing -- has taken an interest. 
1797011	When I manipulate the energies, I feel a presence pushing against my psychic defenses, testing me. 
1797012	Testing me.
1797013	I needed to test the Warp device's capabilities. 
1797014	Running the Titan Manufactorum with it -- or rather, with the 'power source' -- provided a convenient opportunity.
1797015	The techpriests are practically giddy with its success.
1797016	But this is a trivial accomplishment. 
1797017	I am impatient to begin testing the Warp device's psychic attributes.
1797018	I am just waiting for the live cargo to arrive.
1797019	The stench of aliens permeates this facility -- but it is tolerable, because it represents progress. 
1797020	I acquired specimens for experimentation: Ork, Tau, Eldar. 
1797021	Even a Tyranid lictor, which nearly caused a revolt among my techpriest allies.
1797022	I designed the weapon to use the Warp energies to target the weak points in the Xenos brain, and rupture them. 
1797023	That is the tidy theory. 
1797024	When I put it into practice, however, the specimen's head explodes. 
1797025	Distasteful, but effective. 
1797026	The weapon works.
1797027	I've encountered unexpected results. 
1797028	The Warp energies affect different species in different ways. 
1797029	Essentially, I can tune this weapon to cause maximum damage to whatever enemy we face. 
1797030	If humans are caught in the blast wave, they will not be harmed. 
1797031	Good news, I suppose...
1797032	I have not slept in two days. 
1797033	The more I use the Warp device, the stronger the assault on my psychic shields. 
1797034	I need rest...
1797035	The psychic attacks are increasing. 
1797036	I am hearing things, now -- a name, a constant whisper in my mind.
1797037	I must withstand it. 
1797038	Because something completely unexpected has happened: Orks are invading this planet.
1797039	The timing is perfect. 
1797040	The Psychic Scourge weapon is nearly ready, and millions of Orks will prove the ultimate test subjects. 
1797041	I will save this planet. 
1797042	History will remember this as the moment we turned the tide against the alien threat to our people....
1797045	Workers, assemble.
1797046	Caleb, there you are. The Shiring brothers are saying we're under attack!
1797047	The brothers are idiots, Lilith. 
1797048	They saw Roks in the sky. 
1797050	Xenos, here? 
1797051	Damned unlikely.
1797052	Workers, take your stations. 
1797053	Be productive, be dutiful. 
1797054	Begin --
1797057	-- the Orks have reached the Western territories. 
1797058	That's close, Caleb.
1797059	Not when all the planetary defenses -- and the Skitarii -- stand between us and them. 
1797060	First you don't believe there's an invasion, and now you're not worried about it at all.
1797061	Lilith, we have a far better chance of being killed on the assembly line than by a far-away Ork. 
1797062	Workers, take your stations.
1797063	Be productive, be dutiful-- 
1797066	-- I'm surprised you showed up.
1797067	There's no one here.
1797068	I didn't know where else to go. 
1797069	Workers, assemble.
1797070	People are saying the Skitarii are dead. 
1797071	I think people are right. 
1797072	The increase in worker absences has been noted. 
1797073	Delinquent workers will be disciplined. 
1797074	Caleb, what are we going to do?
1797077	-- I say we stay here. 
1797078	This factory is a far better place than the hab blocks to make a last stand.
1797079	A last stand? 
1797080	You're no Skitarii, Caleb. 
1797081	Workers, alert.
1797082	Xenos presence detected.
1797083	This is not a drill.
1797084	If I'm going to die today, I want to face it straight on. 
1797085	You stubborn fool -- you are not going to die today! 
1797086	There's got to be a place where we can hide --
1797089	What took you so long? 
1797090	I saw them. 
1797091	The Orks are in the loading bays. 
1797092	Help me drag this over -- 
1797093	Why are you blocking the door? 
1797094	This room isn't safe enough -- we have to go, Caleb!
1797095	Workers, evacuate.
1797096	Xenos detected. 
1797097	Your safety is not guaranteed.
1797098	It's too late, Lilith.
1797099	There's nowhere to run.  
1797102	Transmechanic Second Class Petronius, entering duty log 31127.
1797103	Communications console functioning: normal. 
1797104	Issues of note: one.
1797105	I detected a signal that should not have been there, but Transmechanic First Class Aleric refused to believe me.
1797106	Yes, I've made mistakes before. 
1797107	That pulsar I thought was a Tau warship. 
1797108	Missing the signal from the Fabricator General's transport.
1797109	But I am not wrong every time!
1797110	There's something approaching from the far side of the sun. 
1797111	I know it.
1797112	I was right! 
1797113	For days, I tracked that signal coming from beyond the sun. 
1797114	I didn't tell Transmechanic First Class Aleric because I didn't want to be ridiculed. 
1797115	And today I heard voices -- the signal's an Ork fleet heading straight for Graia!
1797116	That's when I told Aleric. 
1797117	You should have seen the shock on his face.
1797118	If he'd believed me a week ago, we would have had that much more warning. 
1797119	He was wrong -- I was right.
1797120	Finally. 
1797122	The Orks have thrown my duties into chaos. 
1797123	I only get distress calls now. 
1797124	 'The Xenos are here,' 'The hab block's on fire.' 
1797125	And today, Transmechanic Aleric insisted I contact every single planetary defense outpost. 
1797126	A hundred stations! 
1797127	He just didn't want to do it himself. 
1797128	None of the stations picked up.
1797129	When I told him that, Aleric rushed off. 
1797130	No acknowledgement, no thanks. 
1797131	I suppose even an Ork invasion can't change some people. 
1797132	The Orks broke into the temple. 
1797133	I couldn't hear them -- I was plugged into my console. 
1797134	Then someone crashed into me, hard, from behind -- it was Transmechanic Aleric. 
1797135	He had an Ork axe in his chest.
1797136	He'd blocked the attack meant for me. 
1797137	The Ork went berserk -- he grabbed for me but only caught my robe. 
1797138	I ripped free and ran.
1797139	Aleric saved me. 
1797140	He died, saving me. 
1797141	I don't know if I deserved it. 
1797142	It's been three days since Aleric died, the Orks have finally left the temple. 
1797144	I accessed a comm station. 
1797145	The liberation fleet is on route, with Ultramarines leading an advance force. 
1797146	But they are only now entering the Immaterium. 
1797147	I hope I am wrong, like I've been so many times before. 
1797148	But I fear that by the time the Ultramarines come to our rescue, everyone on this planet will be dead. 
1797150	-- not in the disease ward, Dominus. 
1797151	What's wrong with her?
1797152	Ork projectile to the leg, Magos Cassia.
1797153	Amputations are down the hall. 
1797154	Very well. I shall prepare for the implant grafting--
1797155	No implants. 
1797156	Just get rid of her leg and stitch her up fast.
1797157	We're at war-- 
1797160	-- has a deep wound to the arm.
1797161	Signs of blood poisoning.
1797162	That's from an Ork choppa. 
1797163	We can't stop him from going septic. 
1797164	Make him comfortable and move on.
1797165	You've seen these kinds of wounds before?
1797166	Unfortunately, yes -- in my first Ork invasion, which I hoped would be my last. 
1797167	Yet, here I am again. Right, who's next -- 
1797170	-- we're almost out of sterile dressings. 
1797171	I haven't even begun to treat the new burn victims yet.
1797172	You can't treat them. 
1797173	Give them something for pain. 
1797174	But that is all. 
1797175	I am a Magos Biologis. No wound or malady is beyond me -- 
1797176	You are in a triage situation. 
1797177	Observe, analyze and decide who we can save.
1797180	-- there's no room for them in the south ward. 
1797181	Put them on the second level --
1797182	It's completely full. 
1797183	That's where I've been moving the dying.
1797184	That's it, then. 
1797185	Bar the doors.
1797186	You're closing the infirmary? 
1797187	We are being overrun. 
1797188	We must focus on the wounded already under our care. This is the only way.
1797189	Take the servitors to keep the crowds back --
1797192	-- radio says the Orks are two streets away. 
1797193	Help me with this, Dominus. 
1797194	Hurry.
1797195	What are you injecting him with -- stop! 
1797196	This is a fatal dose! 
1797197	Yes, it is. 
1797198	I have enough for every patient.
1797199	You're murdering them?
1797200	I'm showing them mercy. 
1797201	In ten minutes, the Orks will break through those doors and slaughter them all in their beds.
1797202	Better to die in peace before that. 
1797203	It's the last thing I can do for them --
1797206	Benjamin, plans have changed. 
1797207	Hannah hasn't returned -- I think they're going to close off that whole stratum. 
1797208	I have to get her. 
1797209	You'll be back from the food depot before we are. 
1797210	Tell your mother where I am when she arrives -- and both of you, stay there. 
1797211	Pack up the food as best you can.
1797212	Reports are that the Orks have already reached the Manufactorum. 
1797213	We'll need to leave as soon as we're together. 
1797214	I'll be home soon. 
1797215	Benjamin, we've waited as long as we can. 
1797216	Where are you?
1797217	The Orks are crossing the mainline bridge. 
1797218	I have to get Hannah and your mother out of here. 
1797219	When you get this message, leave immediately -- go to hab block seventy four. 
1797220	We're going to gather with others from our shift-group.
1797221	We have your things. 
1797222	Come and find us -- stay safe. 
1797223	And hurry.
1797224	Benjamin, I feel like I'm leaving breadcrumbs for you to follow.
1797225	We can't wait for you here. 
1797226	The shift-group left without us. 
1797227	The whole idea was safety in numbers, but they didn't bother to wait. 
1797228	This hab block's completely looted. 
1797229	We're heading for Evacuation Centre Epsilon. 
1797230	Look for us there. 
1797231	Be careful, Ben. 
1797232	Benjamin, something terrible has happened. 
1797233	Your mother -- my Julia --
1797234	We got caught in an Ork ambush. 
1797235	They cornered your sister -- she was screaming -- and your mother threw herself at them. 
1797236	They laughed, Benjamin -- the worst sound I have ever heard -- and I grabbed Hannah. 
1797237	But your mother -- they took her and they broke her and I couldn't --
1797238	We made it to Epsilon Centre. 
1797239	Find us, Benjamin. 
1797240	Please, find us. 
1797241	Benjamin, we have to leave Epsilon Center. 
1797242	The Orks are coming. 
1797243	I'm so sorry, Ben -- I can't leave you the next breadcrumb, because I don't have a plan anymore.
1797244	We've lost your mother, and I'm so afraid we've lost you, too.
1797245	I have to keep Hannah safe. 
1797246	That means we can't stay in one place long. 
1797247	But I promise you, Benjamin, I will find you. 
1797248	I will never stop looking.
1797250	Ork dropship!
1797251	Find cover!
1797252	These Greenskins believe in armor, it seems.
1797253	Captain!
1797254	Here are the brakes!
1797255	The Orks have disabled the brakes.
1797256	Captain- look.
1797257	The Orks must be operating that crane.
1797258	They will not stop until they break through that gate.
1797259	What is that crane doing?
1797260	Captain - 
1797261	The Orks have managed to power that cannon.
1797262	That's a volcano cannon.
1797263	Even a single shot will blast right through the gates.
1797264	Number Two Control Deck, do you read?
1797265	Identify yourself.
1797266	Did you drop that cargo on the Orks? 
1797267	There is a service lift in the hangar directly below where you dropped the cargo, my lord.
1797268	We can meet you there.
1797269	A handful of Guardsmen holding that huge gate.
1797270	They cannot last long.
1797271	They did manage to bring the access bridge down, robbing the Orks of their advantage of numbers.
1797273	My lords - you must hurry.
1797274	The Greenskins are on the move again.
1797275	If they find the access point we are using, we will not last long.
1797276	Corporal Antioch.
1797277	We are in position.
1797278	Excellent, Captain.
1797279	I'm sending the lift up now.
1797280	Orks! An entire horde.
1797281	Antioch, hold the lift!
1797282	We have Orks inbound!
1797283	We're trying, Captain!
1797284	But if they get past you, they'll find a way down!
1797285	You must stop them!
1797286	I intend to, Corporal.
1797287	Yes, my lord.
1797288	I will show you the way inside.
1807149	The Xenos haven't left a single structure undamaged.
1807150	Or unbloodied.
1807151	The techpriests will have to bring all of these structures down, and rebuild.
1807153	This time on top of a mass grave.
1807154	There. Drogan said to meet at that monument.
1807155	Whatever you're doing, Captain, keep at it.
1807156	The Greenskins are swarming your way, leaving our path open.
1807157	Captain, we are within sight of the Imperial Guard bastion.
1807158	Captain Titus -
1807159	We are near the landing zone, but it is still swarming with Orks.
1807162	Get me there at maximum speed.
1807163	Understood, Inquisitor.
1807166	My status?!
1807167	This whole planet has gone mad!
1807168	The skies are--
1807169	Do not give into fear now.
1807170	Your troops need you more than ever.
1807171	Yes, Captain.
1807172	Greetings, Ultramarines.
1807173	We will be on the ground shortly--
1807174	We must get to that Valkyrie.
1807175	She crashed further down the canyon.
1807177	Emperor protect us-- 
1807178	Look at the spire.
1807179	That gate-- it's getting bigger.
1807180	We must close it.
1807181	Captain Titus? Do you read?
1807183	I made it out of the crash--
1807184	But this canyon is full of heretics.
1807185	Find shelter. We are on our way.
1807188	Kill that psyker!
1807189	He is keeping the portal open!
1807190	The psyker is dead!
1807191	The portal is closing.
1807193	Captain, duty requires that I put voice to my concerns.
1807197	There are the main walls of the lower Hab Blocks.
1807198	The water supply pipes form a bridge across the canyon.
1807199	A few weeks ago, millions of people lived here.
1807200	An Ork invasion, and now the tender mercies of Chaos heretics.
1807201	I am surprised the place is standing at all.
1807202	The Greenskins have been pressing us hard--
1807203	Both down here and at the bastion proper.
1807205	We’ve seen minimal enemy activity.
1807206	But I don't know the status of the other platoons. 
1807207	The forces of Chaos are driving the Orks before them, so you can expect more attacks.
1807208	The other platoons are going to fall back toward the Bastion. 
1807209	Hold this position, or they'll be cut off.
1807210	Get ready to fall back to the bastion.
1807211	Do not engage Chaos forces directly until I get reinforcements down here to back you up.
1817135	Lieutenant Mira, this is Bastion Primus. 
1817136	We're under heavy assault -- the Orks are back. 
1817137	And they cut power to the sentry guns!
1817138	All of them?
1817139	They took out the generator. 
1817140	We couldn't defend it against such numbers -- we had to fall back. 
1817141	The Ultramarines and I are almost at your position. 
1817142	Mira, out.
1817143	Will we never be free of the damned Orks?
1817150	Imperial Guard!
1817151	Stand your ground!
1817152	The Ultramarines are here!
1817153	Aye, Lieutenant!
1817154	You can see why we need the sentry guns.
1817155	There aren't enough of us to hold this position without them.
1817156	Lieutenant, the central outpost is under attack!
1817157	Tell them we're on our way!
1817158	Move out, brothers.
1817159	Captain -- the turret!
1817160	Captain, use the turret!
1817161	Defend the line -- use the turret!
1817162	The Orks will be back. 
1817163	We need those sentry guns.
1817164	Lieutenant, where is the generator?
1817165	If you continue on, you'll find it at the end of our fortifications. 
1817166	I will contact you once I have restored power.
1817167	Brothers, the Guardsmen will need your help until the guns are reactivated. 
1817168	Lieutenant Mira, the generator is at full power.
1817169	It's working -- the sentry guns are back online!
1817170	Your men should be able to withstand the Ork assault.
1817171	Emperor willing...
1817172	Captain, your men are near an access point to the rail network. My Guardsmen will point the way.
1817173	Another gateway is close to your position.
1817174	I'm on route there now.
1817176	The Imperial Guard is once again in your debt, Captain.
1817177	The rail network is underground -- through here.
1817178	My thanks, Lieutenant.
1817179	You might not be alone down there.
1817180	We were never able to clear the tunnels of Orks. 
1817181	A few Orks will not be a problem.
1817182	I didn't think so. 
1817184	Sidonus to Captain Titus.
1817185	We are running into Orks down here.
1817187	Nothing like above, though.
1817188	Just enough to be an annoyance.
1817189	We will be there soon.
1817193	Captain?
1817194	Finally, some good news.
1817195	Captain Titus, the Orks are running scared.
1817196	What's happened?
1817198	The Captain dealt with their Warboss once and for all.
1817199	We have a chance now...
1817200	This rail line will take us directly to the Titan Manufactorum.
1817201	The faster, the better.
1817202	Those Orks slowed us down.
1817203	And gave Nemeroth time to prepare his invasion.
1817204	We must get to the Titan and destroy that Warp gate.
1827198	Though he is trapped on this world.
1827199	And all the more desperate to recover the power source.
1827200	We must get it to safety, old friend.
1827201	You think the device is still of use to Nemeroth, without the Warp gate?
1827202	Sidonus, contact our allies and find a way off this planet.
1827203	Good news on that front.
1827204	Lieutenant Mira reports that the Liberation Fleet has entered the system.
1827205	The Inquisition will surely have sent agents with the fleet, Captain.
1827206	Perhaps we can return the device to them--
1827207	Contact Lieutenant Mira and have her divert a Valkyrie here to pick us up.
1827208	Tell her we will require transport to the fleet once it enters orbit.
1827209	Yes, Captain. 
1827212	I suppose putting a bolter round through that damnable power source is out of the question.
1827213	My most trusted brother will bring it to our Strike Cruiser and seal it in the armory.
1827214	Lieutenant Mira's Valkyrie is on its way, Captain.
1827215	Excellent.
1827216	We make for the landing pad, and watch for the Chaos Lord's forces.
1827218	Captain, good news. 
1827219	The liberation fleet has entered the system.
1827220	And even better, our Ultramarines battle brothers are on route.
1827221	I’ve got the rendezvous coordinates.
1827225	There! 
1827226	Retrieve the Warp Device!
1827227	Sidonus!
1827228	Get to the Landing Pad!
1827229	Aye, captain!
1827231	These Traitors are determined--
1827232	And this landing pad does not offer much cover.
1827235	Mira here.
1827236	Valkyrie on approach.
1827237	Captain Titus - we're ready to transport you.
1827238	The Sergeant!
1827239	It was Nemeroth.
1827240	That Traitor Lord murdered him.
1827241	The spire? It still stands?
1827242	Its ruins hang in the sky against all reason.
1827243	Chaos forces are concentrated around the tower. 
1827244	The fleet is preparing an all out assault.
1837285	Blood Ravens, attack!
1837286	Forward!
1837287	Go!
1837288	Brothers, forward!
1837289	Press the attack!
1837290	Do not stop!
1837291	Purge the heretics!
1837292	Drive them back!
1847345	Autocannon! We need cover!
1847346	From the floor - heavy servo turret!
1847347	Heavy turret blocking the door!
1847348	Level Four containment breach.
1847349	Extermination protocols engaged.
1847351	Ultramarines - The logic engine thinks we are escaped Xenos specimens.
1847352	There is a control panel in the side room--
1847353	Get me there and I can shut it down.
1847354	Missile launcher!
1847355	Watch for rocket fire!
1847356	Authorization recognized.
1847357	Protocols suspended.
1847358	The exit will open shortly, Captain.
1847359	However, I'm afraid the servo turrets beyond this room remain primed.
1847360	If this is the firing core, Inquisitor, does it discharge through the whole facility?
1847361	No, not precisely.
1847362	The core actually raises to the rooftop of the facility.
1847363	That is where the rest of the firing array is located.
1847364	Inquisitor - The conduits are reconnected.
1847365	Very good, Captain.
1847366	Now proceed to the main control panel.
1847367	You will need to manually restart the array alignment.
1847368	Going there now.
1847369	Psychic Scourge firing sequence commencing.
1847370	Alert - energy levels outside experimental parameters.
1857447	Titus, your jump pack's not firing!
1857448	I've lost steering control.
1857449	Nothing like a challenge...
1897783	Dread Gods of Chaos...
1897784	I am Nemeroth, your herald and champion!
1897785	I have burned a thousand worlds in your dark names!
1897786	You challenged me to recover this fragment of your power, and I have done so!
1897787	The slaves of the False Emperor who dared claim it as their own lie dead at my hand!
1897788	I return your dark relic to you...
1897789	I offer up this world and all those upon it...
1897790	I ask for the reward that was promised!
1897791	The Loyalist is here!
1897792	He thinks to face me in battle!
1897793	Grant me your favor!
1897794	Corrupt my flesh, make me daemonkind!
1897795	Show this fool the true nature of power!
1897796	Nothing can stop my ascension!
1897797	You are no threat to me now, Ultramarine. 
1897798	Your task is hopeless, Titus.
1897799	I have the will of the Dark Gods behind me.
1897800	But you? 
1897801	You have no one. 
1897802	And you will die here, alone.
1897803	Admit it, Titus.
1897804	The power of Chaos is within you, calling to this relic.
1897805	With it, you shattered this mighty spire -- but so much more awaits.
1897806	Imagine the Ultramarines dominating this galaxy in glorious conquest, with you at their head.
1897807	Imagine the power you could wield--
1897808	Killing my servants matters little.
1897809	I am unassailable. 
1897810	The gods of Chaos protect me with the very energies of creation.
